Haughey led four governments while serving as Taoiseach; December 1979 to June 1981, March to December 1982, March 1987 to June 1989, and June 1989 to February 1992. He was also Minister for the Gaeltacht from 1987 to 1992, Leader of the Opposition from 1981 to 1982 and 1982 to 1987, Leader of Fianna Fáil from 1979 to 1992, Minister for Social Welfare and for Health from 1977 to 1979, Minister for Finance from 1966 to 1970, Minister for Agriculture from 1964 to 1966, Minister for Justice from 1961 to 1964 and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice from 1959 to 1961. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1957 to 1992.Haughey was first elected to Dáil Éireann as a Fianna Fáil TD in 1957 and was re-elected at every election until 1992, representing successively the Dublin North-East, Dublin Artane and Dublin North-Central constituencies.\nHaughey was the dominant Irish politician of his generation, as well as the most controversial. Upon entering government in the early 1960s, Haughey became the symbol of a new vanguard of Irish Ministers. As Taoiseach, he is credited by some economists with starting the positive transformation of the economy in the late 1980s. However, his career was also marked by several major scandals. Haughey was implicated in the Arms Crisis of 1970, which nearly destroyed his career. His political reputation revived, his tenure as Taoiseach was then damaged by the sensational GUBU Affair in 1982; his party leadership was challenged four times, each time unsuccessfully, earning Haughey the nickname \"The Great Houdini\". Revelations about his role in a phone tapping scandal forced him to resign as Taoiseach and retire from politics in 1992.\nAfter Haughey's retirement from politics, further revelations of corruption, embezzlement, tax evasion and a 27-year extra-marital affair tarnished his already chequered reputation. He died of prostate cancer in 2006, aged 80.\n\nEarly life\nHe was born in Castlebar, County Mayo in 1925, the third of seven children, of Seán Haughey and Sarah McWilliams, both natives of Swatragh, County Londonderry.  Haughey's father was in the Irish Republican Army during the Irish War of Independence, then in the National Army of the Irish Free State. Seán Haughey left the army in 1928 and the family moved to County Meath; he subsequently developed multiple sclerosis and the family moved again to Donnycarney, a northern suburb of Dublin, where Charles Haughey spent his youth.Haughey was educated by the Irish Christian Brothers at St Joseph's secondary school in Fairview, where one of his classmates was George Colley, subsequently his cabinet colleague and rival in Fianna Fáil. In his youth he was an active amateur sportsman, playing Gaelic football with the Parnells GAA Club in Donnycarney; he won a Dublin Senior Football Championship medal in 1945. Haughey studied commerce at University College Dublin (UCD), where he took a first class Honours degree in 1946. It was at UCD that Haughey became increasingly interested in politics and was elected Auditor of the Commerce & Economics Society. He also met there one of his future political rivals, Garret FitzGerald.He joined the Local Defence Force during \"The Emergency\" in 1941 and considered a permanent career in the Army. He continued to serve in the reserve FCÁ force, until entering Dáil Éireann in 1957.On VE-day Haughey and other UCD students burnt the British Union Jack on College Green, outside Trinity College Dublin, in response to a perceived disrespect afforded the Irish tricolour among the flags hung by the college in celebration of the Allied victory which ended World War II.\nHaughey qualified as a chartered accountant and also attended King's Inns. He was subsequently called to the Irish Bar. Shortly afterwards, he set up the accountancy firm of Haughey, Boland & Company with Harry Boland, son of Fianna Fáil Minister Gerald Boland.\nOn 18 September 1951, he married Maureen Lemass, the daughter of the Fianna Fáil Minister and future Taoiseach Seán Lemass, having been close to her since their days at UCD, where they first met. They had four children together: Eimear, Conor, Ciarán and Seán.After selling his house in Raheny in 1969, Haughey bought Abbeville and its estate of approximately 250 acres (100 ha), located at Kinsealy, north County Dublin.  This historic house, once owned by Anglo-Irish politician John Beresford, had been extensively re-designed by the architect James Gandon in the late 18th century and it became the Haughey family home, where he lived for the rest of his life. This marked the beginning of a long period when Haughey's spending was well beyond his apparent income level. For the rest of his life Haughey would refuse to say where the extra money came from.\n\nEarly political career\nHe started his political career as a local councillor, being a member of Dublin Corporation from 1953 to 1955. Haughey's first attempt at election to Dáil Éireann came in June 1951, when he unsuccessfully contested the general election. While living in Raheny, Haughey was first elected to the Dáil as a Fianna Fáil TD at the 1957 general election for the Dublin North-East constituency; it was his fourth attempt.\nHaughey was re-elected in every election until 1992, representing Dublin North-East from 1957 to 1977, Dublin Artane from 1977 to 1981, and Dublin North-Central from 1981 until his retirement in 1992 (moving constituencies in line with boundary changes).\nIn 1959, Haughey obtained his first government position, that of Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice, serving under his constituency colleague Oscar Traynor, appointed by the first government of his father-in-law Seán Lemass. It is unclear whether the choice was made by Lemass directly as Taoiseach, or by the cabinet against his wishes. Lemass had advised Haughey;\n\nAs Taoiseach it is my duty to offer you the post of parliamentary secretary, and as your father-in-law I am advising you not to take it.\nHaughey ignored Lemass's advice and accepted the offer. Although officially junior to Traynor, Haughey was the de facto minister, as Traynor, a minister in governments since the 1930s, was elderly and in poor health, and only nominally running the department. Haughey and Traynor clashed openly.Haughey came to epitomise the new style of politician – the \"men in the mohair suits\". He regularly socialised with other younger cabinet colleagues, such as Donogh O'Malley and Brian Lenihan.\nBy day he impressed the Dáil. By night he basked in the admiration of a fashionable audience in the Russell Hotel. There, or in Dublin's more expensive restaurants, the company included artists, musicians and entertainers, professionals, builders and business people.\nHis companions, Lenihan and O'Malley, took mischievous delight in entertaining the Russell with tales of the Old Guard. O'Malley in turn entertained the company in Limerick's Brazen Head or Cruise's Hotel with accounts of the crowd in the Russell. On the wings of such tales Haughey's reputation spread.\nHaughey's status by 1961 was such that Leader of the Opposition James Dillon complimented him lavishly on the floor of the Dáil, remarking on his opponent's \"skill with which he has had recourse to his brief,\" as well as his \"extraordinary erudition\" and \"his exceptional and outstanding ability.\"\n\nMinisterial office\nMinister for Justice\nWhen Traynor retired in 1961, Haughey succeeded him as Minister for Justice. As such, he initiated an extensive scale of legislative reforms. He introduced new legislation including the Adoption Act; the Succession Act, which protected the inheritance rights of wives and children; the Criminal Justice Act, which severely restricted the application of capital punishment; and the Extradition Act, which virtually prevented extradition for IRA offences. Haughey also introduced the Special Military Courts which helped to defeat the Irish Republican Army's Border Campaign.\n\nMinister for Agriculture: 1966 Farmers' Strike\nIn 1964, Lemass appointed Haughey as Minister for Agriculture. Criticism was voiced from the National Farmers Association (NFA) of the appointment of a non-rural person to the position, and there was increased antagonism from farmers towards the government. Haughey became embroiled in a series of controversies with the NFA and with another organisation, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association (ICMSA). Twenty-seven ICMSA picketers outside Leinster House, were arrested on 27 April 1966 under the Offences Against the State Act, an act originally intended for use against the IRA. 78 were arrested the following day, and 80 a day later as the dispute escalated. The general public was supportive of the farmers, who were not in a position to hold a strike to air their grievances, and who were clearly only posing a problem to the Minister, rather than the state. The farmers then began a national solidarity campaign, and even farmers who supported Fianna Fáil turned against the government. Haughey, who did not rely on rural voters, was under intense pressure from fearful members of his own party to negotiate a deal and reduce the tension. It was Haughey's first alienation of a significant voting block, and probably damaged him electorally in later years as many farmers remembered the events, known in folk memory as the \"Farmers' Strike\".\n\nMinister for Finance and 1966 presidential election\nHaughey was appointed by Fianna Fáil to run President Éamon de Valera's re-election campaign for the 1966 presidential election. His interventions proved highly controversial. Fine Gael chose a comparatively young TD and barrister, Tom O'Higgins (nephew of Kevin O'Higgins), to run against de Valera. Aware that de Valera's age (84) and almost total blindness might compare unfavourably to O'Higgins, whose campaign drew comparisons with the equally youthful US President John F. Kennedy, Haughey launched what was seen as a political stroke. He insisted that it was beneath the presidency to actively campaign, meaning that de Valera would have a low profile. Therefore, in the interests of fairness the media was asked to give O'Higgins an equally low profile, ignoring his speeches and publicity campaign. The print media, both nationally and locally, ignored Haughey's suggestion. But the state-run Raidió Teilifís Éireann, facing criticism from Lemass' government for being too radical in other areas, agreed and largely ignored the O'Higgins campaign.\nDe Valera got a high media profile from a different source, the fiftieth anniversary commemoration of the Easter Rising, of which he was the most senior survivor. While O'Higgins's campaign was ignored by RTÉ, de Valera appeared in RTÉ coverage of the Rising events regularly. To add further to de Valera's campaign, Haughey as Agriculture Minister arranged for milk price increases to be given to farmers on the eve of polling, as a way of reducing farmer disquiet after they had effectively become an opposition movement to the government.\nThese tactics should have ensured an easy de Valera victory. Instead O'Higgins came within less than one percent of winning the vote, with de Valera re-elected by a narrow margin of ten thousand votes out of a total of nearly one million. De Valera came to distrust Haughey; Frank Aiken, Minister for Foreign Affairs under de Valera and his lifelong political confidant, dismissed Haughey's political motives as being entirely selfish, and believed he was motivated to hold power for its own sake and not duty.\nIn 1966, the Taoiseach Seán Lemass retired. Haughey declared his candidature to succeed Lemass in the consequent leadership election, and George Colley and Neil Blaney did likewise. As this meant that there were three strong candidates who held strong and divisive views on the future of the party, the party elders sought to find a compromise candidate. Lemass himself encouraged his Minister for Finance Jack Lynch, to contest the party leadership, and encouraged Colley, Haughey and Blaney to withdraw in favour of Lynch, arguing that they would not win a contest against him. However, Colley refused the Taoiseach's request and insisted on remaining in the race, but he was defeated by Lynch. Upon Lynch's election as Taoiseach, Haughey was appointed Minister for Finance by Lynch, in a cabinet reshuffle, which indicated that Haughey's withdrawal was a gain at the expense of Colley. The inexpensive and socially inclusive initiatives that Haughey made caught the public imagination; these included popular decisions to introduce free travel on public transport for pensioners, subsidise electricity for pensioners, the granting of special tax concessions for the disabled and tax exemptions for artists. They increased Haughey's populist appeal and his support from certain elements in the media and artistic community.\nAs Minister for Finance, Haughey on two occasions arranged foreign currency loans for the government which he then arranged to be left on deposit in foreign countries (Germany and the United States), in the local currencies, instead of immediately changing the loans to Irish pounds and depositing them in the exchequer. These actions were unconstitutional, because it effectively meant that the Minister for Finance was making a currency speculation against his own currency. When this was challenged by the Comptroller and Auditor General Eugene Francis Suttle, Haughey introduced a law to retrospectively legalise his actions. The debate was very short and the record shows no understanding of the issue by the Opposition Spokesperson for Finance, O'Higgins for Fine Gael and Tully for Labour. The legislation was passed on 26 November 1969.\n\nArms crisis\nThe late 1960s saw the old tensions boil over into an eruption of violence in Northern Ireland. Haughey was generally seen as coming from the pragmatist wing of the party, and was not believed to have strong opinions on the matter, despite having family links with Derry. Indeed, many presumed that he had a strong antipathy to physical force Irish republicanism; during his period as Minister for Justice he had followed a tough anti-IRA line, including using internment without trial against the IRA. The hawks in the cabinet were seen as Kevin Boland and Neil Blaney, both sons of founding fathers in the party with strong Old IRA pasts. Blaney was also a TD for Donegal; a staunchly Republican area which bordered Derry. They were opposed by those described as the \"doves\" of the cabinet; Tánaiste Erskine Childers, George Colley and Patrick Hillery. A fund of £100,000 was set up to give to the Nationalist people in the form of aid. Haughey, as Finance Minister would have a central role in the management of this fund.\nThere was general surprise when, in an incident known as the Arms Crisis, Haughey, along with Blaney, was sacked from Lynch's cabinet amid allegations of the use of the funds to import arms for use by the IRA. The Garda Special Branch informed the Minister for Justice Mícheál Ó Móráin and Taoiseach Jack Lynch that a plot to import arms existed and included government members, however Lynch took no action until the Special Branch made Leader of the Opposition Liam Cosgrave aware of the plot. Cosgrave told Lynch he knew of the plot and would announce it in the Dáil the next day if he didn't act. Lynch subsequently requested Haughey and Blaney to resign from cabinet. Both men refused, saying they did nothing illegal. Lynch then asked President de Valera to terminate their appointments as members of the government, a request that de Valera was required to grant by convention. Boland resigned in sympathy, while Mícheál Ó Móráin was dismissed one day earlier in a preemptive strike to ensure a subservient Minister for Justice was in place when the crisis broke. Lynch chose government chief whip Desmond O'Malley for the role. Haughey and Blaney were subsequently tried in court along with an army Officer, Captain James Kelly, and Albert Luykx, a former Flemish National Socialist and businessman, who allegedly used his contacts to buy the arms. After trial all the accused were acquitted but many refused to recognise the verdict of the courts. Although cleared of wrongdoing, it looked as if Haughey's political career was finished. Blaney and Boland eventually resigned from Fianna Fáil but Haughey remained. He spent his years on the backbenches – the wilderness years – building support within the grassroots of the party; during this time, he remained loyal to the party and served the leader, but after the debacle of the \"arms crises\" neither man trusted the other.\n\nLeadership years\nOpposition to Jack Lynch\nIn 1975, Fianna Fáil was in opposition and Haughey had achieved enough grassroots support to warrant a recall to Jack Lynch's opposition front bench. Haughey was appointed Spokesman on Health and Social Welfare, a fairly minor portfolio at the time, but Haughey used the same imagination and skill he displayed in other positions to formulate innovative and far reaching policies. Two years later in 1977, Fianna Fáil returned to power with a massive parliamentary majority in Dáil Éireann, having had a very populist campaign (spearhead by Colley and O'Malley) to abolish rates, vehicle tax and other extraordinary concessions, which were short-lived. Haughey returned to the cabinet, after an absence of seven years, as Minister for Health and Social Welfare.\nIn this position he continued the progressive policies he had shown earlier by, among others, beginning the first government anti-smoking campaigns and legalising contraception, previously banned. Following the finding by the Supreme Court of Ireland, in McGee v The Attorney General, that there was a constitutional right to use contraceptives, he introduced The Family Planning Bill which proved to be highly controversial. The bill allowed a pharmacist to sell contraceptives on presentation of a medical prescription. Haughey called this bill \"an Irish solution to an Irish problem\". It is often stated that the recipient of the prescription had to be married, but the legislation did not include this requirement.\nThe fallout from the giveaway concessions that had re-elected the government under Lynch, led to a succession race to succeed Lynch. As well as this a group of backbenchers began to lobby in support of Haughey. This group, known as the \"gang of five,\" consisted of Jackie Fahey, Tom McEllistrim, Seán Doherty, Mark Killilea Jnr and Albert Reynolds. Haughey was also helped by the TD Síle de Valera. The granddaughter of Éamon de Valera, she was highly critical of Jack Lynch's policy regards to Northern Ireland. In a speech at the Liam Lynch commemoration at Fermoy on 9 September, de Valera made a series of thinly veiled attacks on Lynch. Although Lynch quickly tried to impose party discipline, attempting to discipline her for opposing party policy at a parliamentary party meeting held at the 28th, de Valera correctly pointed out that she had not opposed the party policy regarding Northern Ireland which called for the declaration of the British intent to withdraw from Northern Ireland. Lynch left for a trip to the United States on 7 November. On the same day the government lost two by-elections to Fine Gael in Cork and in Cork North-East. During the trip Lynch claimed in an interview with The Washington Post that a five-kilometer air corridor between the border was agreed upon during the meeting with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, to enhance security co-operation. This was something highly unsavoury to many in Fianna Fáil. When Lynch returned he was questioned on this by a Clare backbencher Bill Loughnane, along with Tom McEllistrim at a parliamentary party meeting. Lynch stated that the British did not have permission to overfly the border. Afterwards Loughnane went public with the details of the meeting and accused Lynch of deliberately misleading the party. An attempt to remove the whip from Loughnane failed. At this stage Lynch's position had become untenable, with supporters of Haughey and George Colley caucusing opinion within the party.\nIn December 1979, Lynch announced his resignation as Taoiseach and leader of Fianna Fáil. The leadership contest that resulted was a two-horse race between Haughey and the Tánaiste, George Colley. Colley had the support of the entire cabinet, with the exception of Michael O'Kennedy, and felt that this popularity would be reflected within the parliamentary party as a whole.\nHaughey on the other hand was distrusted by a number of his cabinet colleagues, but was much more respected by new backbenchers who were worried about the safety of their Dáil seats. When the vote was taken Haughey emerged as the victor by a margin of 44 votes to 38, a very clear division within the party. In a conciliatory gesture, Colley was re-appointed as Tánaiste and had a veto over whom Haughey would appoint as Ministers for Justice and for Defence. This was due to his distrust of Haughey on security issues (because of the Arms Crisis). However, he was removed from the important position of Minister for Finance.\nNonetheless, on 11 December 1979, Charles Haughey was elected Taoiseach and leader of Fianna Fáil, almost a decade after the Arms Crisis set back his political career. In 2010, a founder of the Saatchi & Saatchi advertising firm, said that Haughey had asked for \"a new image\" similar to the one provided for Margaret Thatcher for the 1979 general election.\n\nTaoiseach (1979–1981)\nWhen Haughey came to power, the country was sinking into a deep economic crisis, following the 1979 energy crisis. Haughey effectively acted as his own Minister for Finance, ignoring the views of his Minister. One of his first functions as Taoiseach was a televised address to the nation – only the third such address in the Republic's history – in which he outlined the bleak economic picture:\nI wish to talk to you this evening about the state of the nation's affairs and the picture I have to paint is not, unfortunately, a very cheerful one. The figures which are just now becoming available to us show one thing very clearly. As a community we are living away beyond our means. I don't mean that everyone in the community is living too well, clearly many are not and have barely enough to get by, but taking us all together we have been living at a rate which is simply not justified by the amount of goods and services we are producing. To make up the difference we have been borrowing enormous amounts of money, borrowing at a rate which just cannot continue. A few simple figures will make this very clear ... we will just have to reorganise government spending so that we can only undertake those things we can afford…\nWhile Haughey had identified the problem with the economy, his actions made the problem worse. He increased public spending, which soon became out of control, and led to increases in borrowing and taxation at an unacceptable level. By 1981, Haughey was still reasonably popular and decided to call a general election. However, the timing of the election was thwarted twice by external events, in particular the hunger strikes of IRA volunteers for political status. The Anti H-Block Committee announced that they would field abstentionist candidates which many predicted correctly would take Republican votes away from Fianna Fáil. This coincided with the Stardust Disaster, where a fire destroyed a night club in Haughey's constituency and claimed the lives of 48 young people; these caused Haughey to delay the Ard Fheis and the election. The poll was eventually held in June, much later than Haughey wanted. In the hope of winning an overall Dáil majority Haughey's campaign took a populist line with regard to taxation, spending and Northern Ireland. The campaign was enhanced and hyped up by a live debate on RTÉ between Haughey and the Leader of the Opposition Garret FitzGerald, of Fine Gael, over the major issues. On the day of the vote Fianna Fáil won 45.5%, failing to secure a majority in the 166-seat Dáil. A Fine Gael–Labour Party coalition came to power, under FitzGerald and Haughey went into opposition.\nWithin days of his becoming Taoiseach, Allied Irish Banks forgave Haughey £400,000 of a £1,000,000 debt. No reason was given for this. The Economist obituary on Haughey (24 June 2006) asserted that he had warned the bank \"I can be a very troublesome adversary\".\n\nOpposition (1981–1982)\nFitzGerald's government lasted until January 1982, when it collapsed due to a controversial budget which proposed the application of Value Added Tax to children's shoes, previously exempt. FitzGerald, no longer having a majority in the Dáil, went to Áras an Uachtaráin, to advise President Hillery to dissolve the Dáil and call a general election. However, the night the government collapsed the Fianna Fáil Front Bench issued a statement encouraging the President not to grant the dissolution and to allow Fianna Fáil to form a government. Phone calls were also made to the President by Brian Lenihan. Haughey, on attempting to contact his former colleague, the President, and on failing to be put through to him, was reported to have threatened the president's aide de camp by telling him that he would be Taoiseach one day and when that happened, \"I intend to roast your fucking arse if you don't put me through immediately\". Hillery considered such pressure to be gross misconduct, and granted the dissolution.\nA biography of Hillery blames Haughey for the sex scandal rumours which almost destroyed the presidency of Hillery in 1979.\n\nSecond term as Taoiseach (1982)\nAfter the February 1982 election, when Haughey failed to win an overall majority again, questions were raised about his leadership. Some of Haughey's critics in the party suggested that an alternative candidate should stand as the party's nominee for Taoiseach. Desmond O'Malley emerged as the likely alternative candidate and was ready to challenge Haughey for the leadership. However, on the day of the vote O'Malley withdrew and Haughey went forward as the nominee. He engineered confidence and supply agreements with the Independent Socialist TD, Tony Gregory (in return for £100 million of investment in the Dublin North Inner City; a deal dubbed the Gregory Deal), the Independent Fianna Fáil TD Neil Blaney and three Workers' Party TDs, which saw him return as Taoiseach for a second time.\nHaughey's second term was dominated by even more economic mismanagement, based on Haughey's policy of using government policy and money, in an effort to induce a sufficiently large share of the electorate to vote him his elusive 'overall majority' in the Dáil. With Haughey and his supporters taking a dangerously populist line in every area of policy, and refusing to address serious shortcomings in the performance of the state, a growing minority in his own party were becoming increasingly concerned. The issue of his leadership cropped up again when in October the backbench TD, Charlie McCreevy, put down a motion of no-confidence in Haughey. Desmond O'Malley disagreed with the timing but supported the hasty motion of no confidence all the same. O'Malley resigned from the cabinet prior to the vote as he was going to vote against Haughey. A campaign now started that was extremely vicious on the side of Haughey's supporters, with threats made to the careers of those who dissented from the leadership. After a marathon 15-hour party meeting, Haughey, who insisted on a roll-call as opposed to a secret ballot, and won the open ballot by 58 votes to 22. Not long after this, Haughey's government collapsed when the Workers' Party TD's and Tony Gregory withdrew their support for the government over a Fianna Fáil policy document called \"The Way Forward,\" which would lead to massive spending cuts. Fianna Fáil lost the November 1982 election and FitzGerald once again returned as Taoiseach at the head of a Fine Gael-Labour coalition with a comfortable Dáil majority. Haughey found himself back in opposition.\nIn August 1982, the Attorney General Patrick Connolly was the subject of controversy when a man in his house was arrested for murder. At a press conference on the affair, Haughey was paraphrased as having described the affair as \"grotesque, unbelievable, bizarre and unprecedented\", from which journalist and former politician Conor Cruise O'Brien coined the term GUBU.\n\nReturn to opposition (1982–1987)\nHaughey's leadership came under scrutiny for a third time when a report linked Haughey with the phone tapping of political journalists. In spite of huge pressure Haughey refused to resign and survived yet another vote of no-confidence in early 1983, albeit with a smaller majority. Haughey's success was partly due to the death of the Fianna Fáil TD Clement Coughlan, a supporter of O'Malley. Haughey's supporters managed to have the meeting moved to the following week after the funeral, which gave him more time to manoeuver. Having failed three times to oust Haughey, most of his critics gave up and returned to normal politics.\nIn May 1984, the New Ireland Forum Report was published. Haughey was involved in the drafting of this at the time he was in office and had agreed to potential scenarios for improving the political situation of Northern Ireland. However, on publication, Haughey rejected it and said the only possible solution was a United Ireland. This statement was criticised by the other leaders who forged the New-Ireland Forum, John Hume, Garret FitzGerald and Dick Spring. Desmond O'Malley supported the Forum report and criticised Haughey's ambiguous position, accusing him of stifling debate. At a Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party meeting to discuss the report, the whip was removed from O'Malley, which meant he was no longer a Fianna Fáil TD. Ironically, when Haughey returned to power he embraced the Anglo-Irish Agreement that had developed from the New Ireland Forum Report.\nIn early 1985, a bill was introduced by the Fine Gael–Labour government to liberalise the sale of contraceptives in the country. Fianna Fáil in opposition opposed the bill. O'Malley supported it as a matter of principle rather than a political point to oppose for opposition's sake. On the day of the vote O'Malley spoke in the Dáil chamber stated:\n\nBut I do not believe that the interests of this State or our Constitution and of this Republic would be served by putting politics before conscience in regard to this ... I stand by the Republic and accordingly, I will not oppose this Bill.\nHe abstained rather than vote with the government. Despite this Haughey moved against O'Malley and in February 1985, O'Malley was charged with \"conduct un-becoming\". At a party meeting, even though O'Malley did not have the party whip, he was expelled from the Fianna Fáil organisation by 73 votes to 9 in roll-call vote. With George Colley dead, O'Malley expelled and other critics silenced, Haughey was finally in full control of Fianna Fáil.\nO'Malley decided to form a new political party and 21 December 1985, Desmond O'Malley announced the formation of the Progressive Democrats. Several Fianna Fáil TDs joined including Mary Harney and Bobby Molloy.\nIn November 1985, the Anglo-Irish Agreement was signed between Garret FitzGerald and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The agreement gave Ireland a formal say in Northern Ireland and its affairs. As was the case with the New Ireland Forum Report, the Anglo-Irish Agreement was harshly criticised by Haughey, who said that he would re-negotiate it, if re-elected. FitzGerald called a general election for February 1987. The campaign was dominated by attacks on the government over severe cuts in the budget and the general mismanagement of the economy. When the results were counted Haughey had failed once again to win an overall majority for Fianna Fáil. When it came to electing a Taoiseach in the Dáil Haughey's position looked particularly volatile. When it came to a vote the Independent TD Tony Gregory voted against Fitzgerald but abstained on Haughey, seeing Haughey as the \"lesser of two evils\" (the reason for this was Gregory's opposition to the Anglo-Irish agreement as well as his personal dislike of Garret FitzGerald and Fine Gael). Haughey was elected Taoiseach on the casting vote of the Ceann Comhairle.\n\nFinal term as Taoiseach (1987–1992)\nHaughey now headed a minority Fianna Fáil government. Fine Gael under leader Alan Dukes, made the unprecedented move, with its Tallaght strategy, of supporting the government and voting for it when it came to introducing tough economic policies. The national debt had doubled under previous administrations, so the government introduced severe budget cuts in all departments. The taxation system was transformed to encourage enterprise and employment. One of the major schemes put forward, and one which would have enormous economic benefits for the country, was the establishment of the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) in Dublin.\nIn late April 1989, Haughey returned from a trip to Japan, to the news that the government was about to be defeated in a Dáil vote, on a private members' motion regarding provision of funds for HIV/AIDS sufferers. The government lost the vote, which was seen as merely embarrassing, but Haughey, buoyed by opinion polls which indicated the possibility of winning an overall majority, called a general election for 15 June. Fianna Fáil however ended up losing four seats and the possibility of forming another minority government looked slim. For the first time in history a nominee for Taoiseach failed to achieve a majority when a vote was taken in the Dáil, on 29 June 1989. Constitutionally Haughey was obliged to resign, however he refused to, for a short period. He eventually tendered his resignation to President Hillery and remained on as Taoiseach, albeit in an acting capacity. A full 27 days after the election had taken place a coalition government was formed between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. It was the first time that Fianna Fáil had entered into a coalition, abandoning one of its \"core values\" in the overwhelming need to form a government.\nHaughey in 1990 had more difficulties than successes. The first half of the year saw Haughey in a leading role as European statesman, when Ireland held the presidency of the European Community, which rotated semi-annually between the member states of the European Union. Haughey supported German Reunification and during the extraordinary Dublin Summit, which he called for in April, he pressed this viewpoint forward. He believed both Ireland and Germany were similar in that both countries were divided. During a Dáil debate on German Reunification, Haughey stated \"I have expressed a personal view that coming as we do from a country which is also divided many of us would have sympathy with any wish of the people of the two German States for unification\".The presidential election was disappointing for Haughey with Brian Lenihan, the Tánaiste, who was nominated as the party's candidate, being defeated by Mary Robinson. During the campaign the controversy over the phone calls made to the Áras an Uachtaráin in 1982, urging the then President not to dissolve the Dáil resurfaced. Lenihan was accused of calling and attempting to influence the President, who as Head of State is above politics. The Progressive Democrats threatened to pull out of the coalition and support a Fine Gael no-confidence motion unless Haughey forced Lenihan out. Haughey tried to force Lenihan to resign, and sacked him when he refused to do so. Lenihan's dismissal damaged Haughey's standing in the Fianna Fáil organisation.\nHaughey's grip on political power began to slip in the autumn of 1991. There was a series of resignations by chairmen of semi-state companies, followed by an open declaration by Minister for Finance Albert Reynolds, that he had every intention of standing for the party leadership if Haughey resigned. Following a heated parliamentary party meeting, Seán Power, one of Reynolds's supporters, put down a motion of no-confidence in Haughey. Reynolds and his supporters were sacked from the government by Haughey, who went on to win the no-confidence motion by 55 votes to 22.\n\nHaughey's victory was short-lived, as a series of political errors would lead to his demise as Taoiseach. Controversy erupted over the attempted appointment of Jim McDaid as Minister for Defence, which saw him withdraw his nomination under pressure from O'Malley. Worse was to follow when Seán Doherty, who as Minister for Justice had taken the blame for the phone-tapping scandal of the early 1980s, went on RTÉ television, and after ten years of insisting that Haughey knew nothing of the tapping, claimed that Haughey had known and authorised it. Haughey denied this, but the Progressive Democrats members of the government stated that they could no longer continue in government with Haughey as Taoiseach. Haughey told Desmond O'Malley, the Progressive Democrats leader, that he intended to stand down shortly, but wanted to choose his own time of departure. O'Malley agreed to this and the government continued.\nOn 30 January 1992, Haughey resigned as leader of Fianna Fáil at a parliamentary party meeting. He remained as Taoiseach until 11 February 1992, when he was succeeded by the former Finance Minister, Albert Reynolds. During his final address to the Dáil he quoted Othello, saying \"I have done the state some service, they know it, no more of that\". Haughey then returned to the backbenches before retiring from politics at the 1992 general election. His son, Seán Haughey, was elected at the election that followed, in his father's old constituency. Seán Haughey was appointed as a Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science in December 2006.\n\nRetirement, tribunals and scandal\nFinancial scandals\nHaughey's personal wealth and extravagant lifestyle (he owned racehorses, a large motor sailing yacht Celtic Mist, an Inishvickillane island and a Gandon-designed mansion) had long been a point of speculation. He refused throughout his career to answer any questions about how he financed this lifestyle on a government salary. Despite his professed desire to fade from public attention, these questions followed him into retirement, eventually exploding into a series of political, financial and personal scandals that tarnished his image and reputation.\nIn 1997, a government-appointed tribunal, led by Judge Brian McCracken, first revealed that Haughey had received substantial monetary gifts from businessmen and that he had held secret offshore bank accounts in the Ansbacher Bank in the Cayman Islands. Haughey faced criminal charges for obstructing the work of the McCracken tribunal. His trial on these charges was postponed indefinitely after the judge in the case found that he would not be able to get a fair trial following prejudicial comments by the then PD leader and Tánaiste Mary Harney.Also in 1997, the public were shocked by allegations that Haughey had embezzled money destined for the Fianna Fáil party, taxpayers' money taken from government funds earmarked for the operation of a political party, and that he had spent large portions of these funds on Charvet shirts and expensive dinners in a top Dublin restaurant, while preaching belt-tightening and implementing budget cuts as a national policy.The subsequent Moriarty Tribunal delved further into Haughey's financial dealings. In his main report on Charles Haughey released on 19 December 2006, Mr Justice Moriarty made the following findings:\n\nHaughey was paid more than IR£8 million between 1979 and 1986 from various benefactors and businessmen, including £1.3 million from the Dunnes Stores supermarket tycoon Ben Dunne. The tribunal described these payments as \"unethical\".\nIn May 1989 one of Haughey's lifelong friends, former government minister Brian Lenihan, underwent a liver transplant which was partly paid for through fundraising by Haughey. The Moriarty tribunal found that of the £270,000 collected in donations for Brian Lenihan, no more than £70,000 ended up being spent on Lenihan's medical care. The tribunal identified one specific donation of £20,000 for Lenihan that was surreptitiously appropriated by Haughey, who took steps to conceal this transaction.\nThe tribunal found evidence of favours performed in return for money (bribes): Saudi businessman Mahmoud Fustok paid Haughey £50,000 to support applications for Irish citizenship.\nIn other evidence of favours performed, the tribunal reported that Haughey arranged meetings between Ben Dunne and civil servant Seamus Pairceir of the Revenue Commissioners. These discussions resulted in an outstanding capital gains tax bill for Dunne being reduced by £22.8 million. Moriarty found that this was \"not coincidental\", and that it was a substantial benefit conferred on Dunne by Haughey's actions.\nAllied Irish Banks settled a million-pound overdraft with Haughey soon after he became Taoiseach in 1979; the tribunal found that the lenience shown by the bank in this case amounted to an indirect payment by the bank to Haughey.The tribunal rejected Haughey's claims of ignorance of his own financial affairs and Haughey was accused by the tribunal of \"devaluing democracy\".Haughey eventually agreed a settlement with the revenue and paid a total of €6.5 million in back taxes and penalties to the Revenue Commissioners in relation to these donations. In August 2003 Haughey was forced to sell his large estate, Abbeville, in Kinsealy in north County Dublin for €45 million to settle legal fees he had incurred during the tribunals. He continued to live at Abbeville and own the island of Inishvickillane off the coast of County Kerry until his death.\n\nTerry Keane affair\nIn May 1999, Terry Keane, gossip columnist and once wife of former Chief Justice of Ireland Ronan Keane, revealed on The Late Late Show that she and Haughey had conducted a 27-year extramarital affair. In a move that she subsequently said she deeply regretted, Keane confirmed that the man she had been referring to for years in her newspaper column as \"sweetie\" was indeed Haughey. The revelation on the television programme shocked at least some of the audience, including Haughey's son Seán who was watching the show. Haughey's wife Maureen was also said to have been deeply hurt by the circumstances of the revelation.\n\nDeath and funeral\nHaughey's attendance before the tribunals had repeatedly been disrupted by illness. He died from prostate cancer, from which he had suffered for a decade, on 13 June 2006, at his home in Kinsealy, County Dublin, aged 80.Haughey received a state funeral on 16 June 2006. He was buried in St. Fintan's Cemetery, Sutton in County Dublin, following mass at Donnycarney. The then Taoiseach Bertie Ahern delivered the graveside oration.The funeral rites were screened live on RTÉ One and watched by a quarter of a million people. It was attended by President Mary McAleese, the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, members of the Oireachtas, many from the world of politics, industry and business. The chief celebrant was Haughey's brother, Father Eoghan Haughey.\n\nLegacy\nFormer Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald said that Haughey had the potential to be one of the best Taoisigh that the country ever had, had his preoccupation with wealth and power not clouded his judgement: Charles Haughey spent much energy fending off leadership challenges, chasing an elusive Dáil majority and dealing with GUBU-like events.\"\nHe comes with a flawed pedigree. ... His motives can ultimately only be judged by God, but we cannot ignore the fact that he differs from his predecessors in that these motives have been widely impugned, most notably by those in his own party who have observed him over many years.\nTaoiseach Bertie Ahern said,\nHe had an immense ability to get things done and he inspired great loyalty amongst many of his followers both inside and outside Fianna Fáil.\nIn recent times, these achievements have become clouded by the revelations that are the subject of inquiry by the Moriarty Tribunal.\n\nHistory will have to weigh up both the credit and the debit side more dispassionately than may be possible today, but I have no doubt its ultimate judgement on Mr Haughey will be a positive one.\nHistorian Diarmaid Ferriter said, He was a very promising minister in the '60s, but once he became leader all he was concerned with was staying leader. It was always about the cult of leadership. His sense of himself was much more important than any vision he had for the country. People say he discovered fiscal rectitude in '87, and people talk about his contribution to Anglo-Irish affairs, but really if you try and look for any consistency in his affairs after the late '70s you can't find it because it's just about him.\nHistorian John A. Murphy said, His vision was one of personal vanity. I don't think history's assessment will be the one Bertie uttered over his grave.\nHaughey was characterised in a 2012 novel Ratlines, by Stuart Neville. A three-part television drama Charlie, covering Haughey between 1979 and 1992, débuted on RTÉ in January 2015, with Aidan Gillen in the title role .\n\nGovernments\nThe following governments were led by Haughey:\n\n16th Government of Ireland (December 1979 – June 1981)\n18th Government of Ireland (March 1982 – December 1982)\n20th Government of Ireland (March 1987 – July 1989)\n21st Government of Ireland (July 1989 – February 1992)\n\nSee also\nFamilies in the Oireachtas\nHaughey\nHaughey (TV series)\nPassage 2:\nMembers of the 25th Dáil\nThe 25th Dáil was elected at the 1987 general election on 17 February 1987 and met on 10 March 1987.

He was most renowned for being the political adviser to former Taoiseach Charles Haughey. He also served as Press Secretary to Fianna Fáil from 1983 to 1987 and Government Press Secretary from 1987 to 1992.He was appointed the Fianna Fáil Director of Elections for the 1997, 2002, and 2007 general elections. He was a member of the board of Digicel, the company founded by Denis O'Brien to build mobile networks in the Caribbean.\nHe was regularly lampooned on the satirical Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ) radio sketch show Scrap Saturday, which ran from 1989 to 1991.\n\nEarly life\nMara was born in Galway, but was raised in Millmount Avenue in Drumcondra, Dublin. He was educated at O'Connell's Richmond Street, and at Coláiste Mhuire, an Irish-language Christian Brothers secondary school (Gaelscoil) on Parnell Square. Mara's father, a Garda, died when Mara was still in school. He was raised by his mother and sister. After school, Mara worked at Boland's Mill for a short time. After a few more jobs, he started working in the textiles industry.\n\nEarlier career\nMara started becoming actively involved in politics in his late 20s, having come from a family background of support for Fianna Fáil. He unsuccessfully ran for public office multiple times.\nMara began to show interest in the career of Charles Haughey in 1970, during the Arms Trial, and began a professional relationship with him, eventually becoming his right hand man and confidante. Haughey and Mara at the time would travel around Ireland visiting local branches of Fianna Fáil. Mara assisted Haughey with strategy during election campaigns. His attempts at a non-political entrepreneurial career were sidelined by his political aspirations, including his carpet sales business, which failed.\nWhen Haughey came back from the political wilderness in the late 1970s, Mara helped to secure support for him in the 1979 leadership election of the party. In his first government, Haughey appointed Mara as a senator.\nIn 1982, despite having no previous experience in public relations, Mara was appointed press secretary for Fianna Fáil by Haughey. He made innovations in how to operate public relations for the party, including holding opposition press briefings. He also tried to increase the electability of Haughey, particularly among young people. \nMara adopted techniques of electioneering from US politics for the campaign for the 1987 Irish general election. He devised a strategy for the election by consulting with a broad range of people, to aid re-election. When the party went back into government in 1987 with Haughey as Taoiseach, Mara served as the press secretary for the new government, and until the resignation of Haughey. He did not work with Albert Reynolds in government.\n\nFlood Tribunal\nMara was one of the components of the so-called Century Radio module at the Flood Tribunal. Mara told the Tribunal that during the course of his employment as a Press Secretary, his financial remuneration was not sufficient to meet his immediate financial requirements, and he experienced financial difficulties. He said he received assistance from his friends, Oliver Barry and financier Dermot Desmond, in the form of loans. However, there was no interest charge, nor was there any fixed schedule for repayment. Those making the loans did not intend that the sums advanced would be treated as gifts by Mara, but were content to receive their money back, once Mara was in a position so to do. Desmond told the Tribunal that he had lent £46,000 to Mara between 1986 and 1989. Barry said he remembered lending Mara a sum of £2,000 on one occasion between 1982 and 1984.In the Second Interim Report of the Flood Tribunal, Judge Feargus Flood found that Mara failed to co-operate with the Tribunal by: \"Failing to provide the Tribunal with details of an account in the name of Pullman Limited, operated by him at Royal Bank of Scotland in the Isle of Man, when swearing his Affidavit of Discovery made pursuant to an Order of the Tribunal requiring him to discover, inter alia", "full_doc_id": "doc-b8d5ff55d95a79e7cabe8439a3dbecec", "file_path": "unknown_source"}, {"__id__": "chunk-9905f80218293261208f32bb65a5e553", "__created_at__": 1742539145.171723, "content": "and seconded by Garret FitzGerald (FG) for the position.

At the ensuing Arms Trial, charges against Blaney were dropped, and Haughey, along with co-defendants Captain James Kelly, John Kelly and Belgian businessman Albert Luykx, were found not guilty of conspiracy. Blaney claimed that the then government knew about the plan, while Haughey denied this.\n\nBackground\nThe events occurred during the Fianna Fáil government of Jack Lynch. Amid the 1969 Northern Ireland riots, which would lead to the Troubles, nationalist families were being forced from their homes, and refugees \"streamed over the border\" into the Republic. The Dublin government established a cabinet subcommittee to organise emergency assistance and relief.  Haughey, then Minister for Finance and the hardline Blaney, Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries who was from the Donegal North-East constituency bordering Northern Ireland were members of the subcommittee, along with Pádraig Faulkner and Joseph Brennan. Jack Lynch took little interest in the work of the subcommittee, and after an initial meeting, Faulkner and Brennan seem to have left their senior colleagues Haughey and Blaney to their own devices. A government fund of £100,000 was set up to provide relief to civilians forced out of their homes by the Troubles, and Haughey was given sole authority over this money.Haughey and Blaney disapproved of the cautious policies of Taoiseach Lynch on Northern Ireland and favoured a more robust approach. In August 1969, after Blaney had proposed military intervention in Northern Ireland, Lynch had asked Irish Army Intelligence to draft proposals for limited military intervention in Northern Ireland to protect nationalist areas from Ulster loyalist mobs, known as Exercise Armageddon, but it was seen to be unworkable and was not adopted by the cabinet. The nationalist areas were given a form of protection later in August by British forces in Operation Banner, and Lynch saw this as an effective short-term measure. On 30 October 1968, Lynch had met with Harold Wilson, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, in London and had called on Britain to take steps to end the partition of Ireland.\nBlaney, the then Minister of Agriculture, was an outspoken critic of government policy on Northern Ireland. In a speech in 1969 he said \"the Fianna Fail party has never taken a decision to rule out the use of force if the situation in the Six Counties so demand\". Haughey had not publicly opposed Lynch's policy, but was concerned about being outflanked by his Fianna Fail leadership rival.\nIn October 1969, a meeting of the Northern Citizen Defence Committees, which had been set up to defend nationalist areas from unionist attack, and which included IRA officers, was held in Bailieborough, County Cavan, with Irish Army intelligence officer Captain James Kelly in attendance. Captain Kelly promised the Northern Citizen Defence Committees  £50,000, that would be made available to buy weapons for defense of nationalist areas against loyalist attack.\nAfter the Bailiebourough meeting, Kelly reported directly to Blaney, who in turn brought him to Haugheys's house to give account of the meeting. Kelly suggested that the government should support the IRA, acknowledging \"this would mean accepting the possibility of armed action of some sort as the ultimate solution\".Blaney allegedly made plans with Captain Kelly to import weapons from continental Europe. Haughey provided the money for the purchase from his civilian relief fund, and also made a failed attempt to arrange customs clearance for the shipment.Haughey met with the IRA Chief of Staff Cathal Goulding. Garda Special Branch informed the Minister for Justice Mícheál Ó Móráin of this meeting and he reported it to the Cabinet, but Haughey dismissed it as a chance encounter. In November 1969, a Belfast republican leader named John Kelly, and Haughey's brother Jock, traveled to London to purchase arms, but Kelly became suspicious that their plot had been discovered and they returned to Ireland.\n\nRevelation and trial\nBy late April 1970, the Garda Síochána Special Branch were aware of the plot and had informed Lynch. However, Lynch took no action until the leader of the opposition, Liam Cosgrave was also informed by the Special Branch of the smuggling scheme and pressed the Taoiseach to take action. Haughey and Blaney were sacked by Lynch on 6 May when they refused to resign.  Kevin Boland, the Minister for Social Welfare resigned from the government in protest at the sackings as he was adamant (as were the accused) that Jack Lynch and most of the Cabinet—in particular Jim Gibbons, then Minister for Defence—knew about the plan to import arms. The Minister for Justice, Mícheál Ó Móráin who was in hospital at the time was asked to resign on 4 May. He later claimed that he had in fact informed Lynch of the individuals involved.\nOn 28 May 1970, Haughey and Blaney went on trial in Dublin, together with an Irish Army intelligence officer, Captain James Kelly, John Kelly and Belgian businessman Albert Luykx, who had allegedly agreed to use his contacts to acquire the weapons. All charges against Blaney were dropped in the District Court on 2 July 1970 and as a result he was not tried, before the main trial got underway under Justice Aindrias Ó Caoimh. The trial collapsed a week later as Ó Caoimh withdrew after allegations of bias. Following a second trial, presided over by Justice Seamus Henchy, the other four defendants were cleared on 23 October.At the trial there was a direct contradiction of evidence regarding the sanctioning of the imports between Haughey and the chief prosecutorial witness, Jim Gibbons, Minister for Defence at the time of the attempted imports. Haughey admitted arranging customs clearance for the shipment, but claimed in his defence that he did not know it consisted of weapons. This directly contradicted the evidence of Gibbons and Peter Berry that Haughey was fully aware of all the details of the conspiracy. It also contradicted the testimony of his co-defendants, who admitted that they had tried to import weapons, but maintained that the shipment had been legally authorised by the government. During the trial the judge remarked that either Haughey or Gibbons had to be committing perjury.\n\nImpact\nThe resignations and sackings left four vacancies in cabinet.  As a result, there was a major cabinet reshuffle and some senior politicians of the future, such as Desmond O'Malley and Gerry Collins, got their first step on the ministerial ladder.\nThe scandal led to bitter divisions in Fianna Fáil between supporters of the sacked ministers Haughey and Blaney and supporters of Lynch.  The same divisions affected government policy on Northern Ireland.  Although the events led to Haughey being demoted to the back-benches, he remained a member of Fianna Fáil, while Boland was expelled in 1970 and Blaney in 1971.  Blaney went on to found his own party, Independent Fianna Fáil, which re-joined Fianna Fáil in 2006, eleven years after Blaney's death.  Haughey later returned to ministerial office and succeeded Lynch as party leader in 1979. There was no rapprochement in the relationship between Gibbons and Haughey and when Haughey became Taoiseach, Gibbons was dropped from his ministerial office.  During a later leadership contest, Gibbons was assaulted in Dáil Éireann by Haughey supporters in retaliation for his testimony at the Arms Trial.The events came to be one of the defining periods of Lynch's term as leader, during which there were several crises.  Lynch supporters saw him as exhibiting strength in facing down the rebel ministers and his detractors saw it as an illustration of his weakness on the national question and procrastination in the face of difficult decisions.\nAs state papers relating to the period were released after 1995, further light was shed on the events, questioning the outcome.  Much remains unknown about the truthfulness of the various personalities involved, and what exactly each knew, and when they came to know it. The diaries of Peter Berry, Secretary of the Department of Justice, published in Magill magazine, claimed that Lynch had not been forthright publicly. Documents released through the Freedom of Information Act 30 years later showed that the state had altered statements by Colonel Hefferon to suppress the fact that he and Captain Kelly had kept Gibbons informed. This caused the then Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, to publicly state that Captain Kelly had done nothing wrong.\n\nSee also\nExercise Armageddon\nPassage 8:\nMembers of the 27th Dáil\nThe 27th Dáil was elected at the 1992 general election on 25 November 1992 and met on 14 December 1992.

The RKKY interaction competes\nwith the Kondo effect and leads to the quantum phase transition of a still debated nature\n\\cite{Doniach,Jones,Affleck,Bork,Neel,KondoRKKYexp,Hans,Hans2,Fabian}.\nMoreover, in DQDs coupled in series also \\emph{superexchange} can alter the Kondo physics significantly\n\\cite{Zitko_2QDEx,Sela}.\n\nRecently, hybrid quantum devices, in which the interplay between various magnetic correlations\nwith superconductivity (SC) plays an important role, have become an important direction of research\n\\cite{hybridQDs,SCspintronics}. In particular, chains of magnetic atoms on SC surface have proven \nto contain self-organized Majorana quasi-particles and exotic spin textures\n\\cite{Braunecker,Klinovaja,Vazifeh,Yazdani},\nwhile hybrid DQD structures have been used to split the Cooper pairs coherently into two entangled \nelectrons propagating to separated normal leads \\cite{CPS1,CPS2,CPS4,CPS5,CPS9}.\nThe latter is possible due to non-local (\\emph{crossed}) Andreev reflections (CARs),\nin which each electron of a Cooper pair tunnels into different QD, and\nsubsequently to attached lead. Such processes give rise to an exchange mechanism \\cite{Yao},\nthat we henceforth refer to as \\emph{the CAR exchange}, which can greatly modify\nthe low-temperature transport behavior of correlated hybrid nanostructures.\n\nThe CAR exchange may be seen as RKKY-like interaction between\ntwo nearby impurities on SC surface \\cite{Yao}.\nThe effect can be understood as a consequence\nof spin-dependent hybridization of the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR)\nstates \\cite{Yu,Shiba,Rusinov} in SC contact,\ncaused both by the overlap of their wave functions\nand their coupling to Cooper-pair condensate.\nThis process is the most effective when the YSR states \nare close to the middle of the SC gap, {\\it e.g.} in the YSR-screened phase \\cite{YSRscreening}.\nThe mechanism presented here is essentially the same,\nyet in the considered regime can be understood\nperturbatively without referring to YSR states,\nas a consequence of the non-local pairing induced by SC electrode. \nIn particular, the presence of YSR bound states close to the Fermi level \nis not necessary for significant consequences for the Kondo physics, \nas long as some inter-dot pairing is present. \n\n\nThe proximity of SC induces pairing in QDs \\cite{RozhkovArovas,Buitelaar} \nand tends to suppress the Kondo effect if the superconducting energy gap $2\\Delta$ \nbecomes larger than the relevant Kondo temperature $T_K$ \n\\cite{Buitelaar2002Dec,adatomsSC,Kondo_vs_SC1,Kondo_vs_SC2,Zitko_Kondo-Andreev,Zitko_S-QD-N,IW_Sau,YSRscreening}.\nMoreover, the strength of SC pairing can greatly affect the Kondo physics in the sub-gap transport regime:\nFor QDs attached to SC and normal contacts, it can enhance the Kondo effect\n\\cite{DomanskiIW,KWIW,part1}, while\nfor DQD-based Cooper pair splitters, it tends to suppress both the $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\\mathrm{SU}(4)$ Kondo effects \\cite{IW_Kacper}.\nOur main result is that the non-local pairing induced by superconducting \nproximity effect, which gives rise to CAR exchange, can be the sole cause of the Kondo screening.\nMoreover, relatively small values of coupling to SC, $\\GS{}\\ll U$, are sufficient for the effect to occur.\nThis is in contrast to the DQD system considered in Ref.~\\cite{part1},\nwhere only one of the quantum dots is proximized, such that \nCAR exchange cannot arise,\nand the Kondo physics becomes qualitatively\naffected only for $\\GS{}\\sim U/2$.%\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[bt]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=1\\linewidth]{Fig1.png}\n\\caption{\n\t\t (a) Schematic of the considered system.

In summary,\nthe effects discussed in \\Sec{main} remain qualitatively valid in all these cases.\nThe paper is concluded in \\Sec{conclusions}.\n\n\n\\section{Model}\n\\label{sec:model}\n\nThe schematic of the considered system is depicted in \\fig{system}(a).\nIt contains two QDs attached to a common SC lead.\nOnly one of them (QD1) is directly attached to the left (L) and right (R) normal leads,\nwhile the other dot (QD2) remains coupled only through QD1.\nThe SC is modeled by the BCS Hamiltonian, \n$H_{\\mathrm{S}}=\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}\\sigma}\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}}a_{\\mathbf{k}\\sigma}^{\\dag}a_{\\mathbf{k}\\sigma}-\\Delta\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}}(a^\\dag_{\\mathbf{k}\\uparrow}a_{-\\mathbf{k}\\downarrow}^{\\dag}+a_{-\\mathbf{k}\\downarrow}a_{\\mathbf{k}\\uparrow})$,\nwith energy dispersion $\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}}$, energy gap $2\\Delta>0$ and $a_{\\mathbf{k}\\sigma}$ annihilation operator \nof electron possessing spin $\\sigma$ and momentum $\\mathbf{k}$. The coupling between\nSC and QDs is described by the hopping Hamiltonian \n$H_{\\mathrm{TS}}=\\sum_{i\\mathbf{k}\\sigma}v_{\\mathrm{S}i}(d^\\dagger_{i\\sigma}a^{}_{\\mathbf{k}\\sigma}+h.c.)$,\nwith $d^\\dagger_{i\\sigma}$ creating a spin-$\\sigma$ electron at QD$i$. The matrix element \n$v_{\\mathrm{S}i}$ and the normalized density of states of SC in normal state, $\\rho_{\\rm S}$, \ncontribute to the coupling of QD$i$ to SC electrode as $\\GS{i} = \\pi \\rho_{\\rm S} |v_{{\\rm S}i}|^2$. \nWe focus on the sub-gap regime, therefore, we integrate out SC degrees of freedom lying outside the energy gap \\cite{RozhkovArovas}.\nThis gives rise to the following effective Hamiltonian,\n$H_{\\mathrm{eff}}=H_{\\mathrm{SDQD}}+H_{\\rm L}+H_{\\rm R}+H_{\\rm T}$, \nwhere \n\\begin{eqnarray}\nH_{\\rm SDQD} \t& = & \n\t\t\t\t\\sum_{i\\sigma} \\varepsilon_{i} n_{i\\sigma} \n\t\t\t\t+\\sum_{i} U n_{i\\uparrow} n_{i\\downarrow} \n\t\t\t\t+U' (n_1-1)(n_2-1) \n\t\t\t\t\\nonumber\\\\\n\t\t\t\t&+&\\sum_\\sigma t(d^\\dagger_{1\\sigma}d^{}_{2\\sigma} + h.c.) \n\t\t\t\t+J \\vec{S}_1\\vec{S}_2\n\t\t\t\t\\nonumber\\\\\n\t\t\t\t&+&\\sum_{i} \\!\\!\\left[ \\Gamma_{{\\rm S}i} (d^\\dagger_{i\\uparrow} d^\\dagger_{i\\downarrow} \\!+\\! h.c.)\n\t\t\t\t+\\Gamma_{\\rm SX} (d^\\dagger_{i\\uparrow} d^\\dagger_{\\bar{i}\\downarrow} \\!+\\! h.c.) \\right]\n\t\\label{H_DQD} \n\\end{eqnarray}\nis the Hamiltonian of the SC-proximized DQD\n\\cite{IW_Kacper,Walldorf2018Feb}, with QD$i$ energy level $\\varepsilon_i$,\ninter-site (intra-site) Coulomb interactions $U'$ ($U$),\ninter-dot hopping $t$, and CAR coupling $\\GS{\\rm X}$.\n$n_{i\\sigma}=d^\\dagger_{i\\sigma}d^{}_{i\\sigma}$ denotes the electron number operator \nat QD$i$, $n_i=n_\\uparrow+n_\\downarrow$, and $\\bar{i}\\equiv 3-i$. \nOur model is strictly valid in the regime where $\\Delta$ is the largest \nenergy scale. Nevertheless, all discussed phenomena are\npresent in a full model for energies smaller than SC gap.\nMoreover, by eliminating other consequences of the presence of SC lead,\nour model pinpoints the fact that the non-local pairing is \nsufficient for the occurrence of the CAR exchange.\nThe presence of out-gap states shall result mainly in additional broadening of DQD energy levels,\nchanging the relevant Kondo temperatures.\nWe note that the procedure of integrating out out-gap states neglects the \nRKKY interaction mediated by SC lead and other possible indirect exchange mechanisms%\n \\footnote{\n Note, that by RKKY interaction we mean only such an effective exchange, \n which arises due to multiple scattering of a single electron or hole, see \\fig{system}(h)-(j).\n Other mechanisms leading to the total indirect exchange are considered separately.\n In particular, in the large gap limit, exchange described in Ref.~\\cite{Yao} is in fact reduced to\n the CAR exchange, and additional antiferromagnetic contribution would arise for finite gap.\n }. \nTo compensate for this,\nwe explicitly include the Heisenberg term $ J \\vec{S}_1\\vec{S}_2$ in\n$H_{\\rm SDQD}$, with $\\vec{S}_i$ denoting the spin operator of QD$i$\nand a Heisenberg coupling $J$ substituting the genuine RKKY exchange.\n\nThe normal leads are treated as reservoirs of noninteracting electrons,\n$H_{r}=\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}\\sigma}\\varepsilon_{r\\mathbf{k}}c^\\dagger_{r\\mathbf{k}\\sigma}c^{}_{r\\mathbf{k}\\sigma}$,\nwhere $c^{}_{r\\mathbf{k}\\sigma}$ annihilates an electron of spin \n$\\sigma$ and momentum $\\mathbf{k}$ in lead $r$ ($r={\\rm L,R}$) with the corresponding energy $\\varepsilon_{r\\mathbf{k}\\sigma}$.\nThe tunneling Hamiltonian reads,\n$H_{\\rm T} = \\sum_{r\\mathbf{k}\\sigma} v_{r} (d^\\dagger_{1\\sigma}c^{}_{r\\mathbf{k}\\sigma} + h.c.)$,\ngiving rise to coupling between lead $r$ and QD$i$ of strength $\\Gamma_r = \\pi \\rho_r |v_r|^2$,\nwith $\\rho_r$ the normalized density of states of lead $r$ and $v_r$ the \nlocal hopping matrix element, assumed momentum-independent.\nWe consider a wide-band limit, assuming constant $\\Gamma_r=\\Gamma/2$\nwithin the cutoff $\\pm D = \\pm 2U$ around the Fermi level. \n\nFor thorough analysis of the CAR exchange mechanism and its consequences\nfor transport, we determine the linear conductance between the two normal leads from\n\\begin{equation}\nG = \\frac{2e^2}{h} \\pi \\Gamma \\int \\left[ -\\frac{\\partial f_T}{\\partial\\omega} \\right] \\mathcal{A}(\\omega) {\\rm d} \\omega ,\n\\label{G}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $f_T$ is the Fermi function at temperature $T$,\nwhile $\\mathcal{A}(\\omega)$ denotes the normalized local spectral density \nof QD1 \\cite{fn1}.\nHenceforth, unless we state otherwise, we assume a maximal CAR coupling, \n$\\GS{\\rm X} = \\sqrt{\\GS{1}\\GS{2}}$ \\cite{IW_Kacper,Walldorf2018Feb},\n$\\GS{1}=\\GS{2}=\\GS{}$ and consider DQD tuned to the particle-hole symmetry point, \n$\\varepsilon_1=\\varepsilon_2=-U/2$. However, these assumptions are not crucial for the results presented\nhere, as discussed in Secs.~\\ref{sec:asym}-\\ref{sec:coef}.\n\n\\section{Estimation of relevant energy scales}\n\\label{sec:scales}\n\nSince we analyze a relatively complex system, let us build up the understanding of its behavior starting\nfrom the case of a QD between two normal-metallic leads, which can be obtained in our \nmodel by setting $t=\\GS{}=J=U'=0$. Then, the conductance as a function of temperature, $G(T)$, grows\nbelow the Kondo temperature $T_K$ and reaches maximum for $T\\to 0$, $G(T\\!=\\!0)=G_{\\rm max}$.\nAt particle-hole symmetry point, the unitary transmission is achieved, $G_{\\rm max}= G_0 = 2e^2/h$;\nsee short-dashed line in \\fig{G-T}(a).\nAn experimentally relevant definition of $T_K$ is that at $T=T_K$ \n$G(T)=G_{\\rm max}/2$. $T_K$ is exponentially small in \nthe local exchange $J_0 = 8\\Gamma / (\\pi \\rho U)$, and is approximated by\n$T_K \\approx D \\exp[-1/(\\rho J_0)]$ \\cite{Hewson_book}.\n\nThe presence of a second side-coupled QD, $t,U'>0$, significantly enriches the physics of the system \nby introducing direct exchange between QDs, see \\fig{system}(b-d).\nIn general, effective inter-dot exchange can be defined as energy difference between \nthe triplet and singlet states of isolated DQD, \n$J^{\\mathrm{eff}} = E_{S=1} - E_{\\rm GS}$. Unless $U$ becomes very large, superexchange can be neglected\n\\cite{Zitko_2QDEx} and $J^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is determined by \\emph{direct exchange}, $J^{\\mathrm{eff}}\\approx 4t^2/(U-U')>0$.\nWhen the hopping $t$ is tuned small \\cite{CPS1}, one can expect $J^{\\mathrm{eff}}\\lesssim T_K$, which \nimplies the two-stage Kondo screening \\cite{Pustilnik_Glazman,Cornaglia}.\nThen, for $T \\ll T_K$, the local spectral density of QD1 serves as a band of width $\\sim T_K$ for QD2.\nThe spin of an electron occupying QD2 \nexperiences the Kondo screening below the associated Kondo temperature\n\\begin{equation}\nT^* = a T_K \\exp(- b T_K / J_{\\rm eff})\n\\label{Tstar}\n\\end{equation}\nwith $a$ and $b$ constants of order of unity \\cite{Pustilnik_Glazman,Cornaglia}.\nThis is reflected in conductance, which drops to $0$ with lowering $T$, maintaining characteristic \nFermi-liquid \n$G\\sim T^2$ dependence \\cite{Cornaglia}; see the curves indicated with squares \nin \\fig{G-T}(a). Similarly to $T_K$, experimentally relevant definition of $T^*$ is that \n$G(T\\!=\\!T^*) = G_{\\rm max}/2$. Even at the particle-hole \nsymmetry point $G_{\\rm max} < G_0$, because the single-QD strong-coupling fixed point \nis unstable in the presence of QD2 and $G(T)$ does not achieve $G_0$ exactly,\nbefore it starts to decrease.\n\n\nThe proximity of SC gives rise to two further exchange mechanisms that\ndetermine the system's behavior. First of all, the (conventional)\n\\emph{RKKY interaction} appears, $J \\sim \\GS{}^2$ \\cite{RK,K,Y}. \nMoreover, the \\emph{CAR exchange} emerges as a consequence of finite $\\GS{}$ \\cite{Yao}. \nIt can be understood on the basis \nof perturbation theory as follows. DQD in the inter-dot singlet state may absorb\nand re-emit a Cooper pair approaching from SC; see \\fig{system}(e)-(g). As a second-order\nprocess, it reduces the energy of the singlet, which is the ground state of isolated DQD.\nA similar process is not possible in the triplet state due to spin conservation.\nTherefore, the singlet-triplet energy splitting $J^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is increased (or generated for $t=J=0$). \nMore precisely, the leading ($2$nd-order in $t$ and $\\GS{}$) terms\nin the total exchange are \n\\begin{equation}\nJ^{\\mathrm{eff}} \t\\approx \tJ + \\frac{4t^2}{U-U'+\\frac{3}{4}J} + \\frac{4\\GS{}^2}{U+U'+\\frac{3}{4}J}.\n\\label{Jeff}\n\\end{equation}\nUsing this estimation, one can predict $T^*$ for finite $\\GS{}$, $t$ and $J$ with \\eq{Tstar}.\nApparently, from three contributions corresponding to:\n(i) RKKY interaction, (ii) direct exchange and (iii) CAR exchange, only the first may bear a negative (ferromagnetic) sign.\nThe two other contributions always have an anti-ferromagnetic nature.\nMore accurate expression for $J^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is derived in Appendix~\\ref{sec:downfolding}\n[see \\eq{A_J}] by the Hamiltonian down-folding procedure. The relevant terms differ \nby factors important only for large $\\GS{}/U$. \nFinally, it seems worth stressing that normal leads are not necessary for CAR exchange to occur.\nAt least one of them is inevitable for the Kondo screening though, and two symmetrically coupled \nnormal leads allow for measurement of the normal conductance.\n\n\nIt is also noteworthy that inter-dot Coulomb interactions\ndecrease the energy of intermediate states contributing to direct exchange \n[\\fig{system}(c)], while increasing the energy of intermediate\nstates causing the CAR exchange [\\fig{system}(f)].\nThis results in different dependence of corresponding terms in \\eq{Jeff} on $U'$.\nAs can be seen in \\figs{G-T}(b) and \\ref{fig:G-T}(c), it has a significant effect \non the actual values of $T^*$.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=1\\linewidth]{Fig2.pdf}\n\\caption{(a) Linear conductance $G$ as function of $T$ calculated for \n\t\t $\\varepsilon_1=\\varepsilon_2=-U/2$, $\\Gamma=U/5$, $U'=U/10$ and different situations, \n\t\t as indicated.

Therefore, we first neglect the conventional RKKY coupling and analyze its consequences in Sec.~\\ref{sec:RKKY}.\n\nThe main results are presented in \\fig{G-T}(a), showing the temperature dependence of $G$\nfor different circumstances. \nFor reference, results for $\\GS{}=0$ are shown, exhibiting \nthe two-stage Kondo effect caused by \\emph{direct} exchange mechanism.\nAs can be seen in \\figs{G-T}(b) and \\ref{fig:G-T}(c), an excellent agreement of $T^*$ found from NRG calculations and \\eq{Tstar} \nis obtained with $a=0.42$ and $b=1.51$, the same for both $U'=0$ and $U'=U/10$. Note, \nhowever, that $J^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is different in these cases, cf. \\eq{Jeff},\nand $U'$ leads to increase of $T^*$.\n\nFurthermore, for $t=0$ and $\\GS{}>0$ the two-stage Kondo effect caused solely by the \\emph{CAR\nexchange} is present; see \\fig{G-T}(a).\nExperimentally, this situation\ncorresponds to a distance between the two QDs smaller than the superconducting coherence length,\nbut large enough for the exponentially suppressed direct hopping to be negligible.\nWhile intuitively one could expect pairing to compete with any kind of magnetic ordering,\nthe Kondo screening induced by CAR exchange is a beautiful example of a superconductivity\nin fact leading to magnetic order, namely the formation of the Kondo singlet.\nThis CAR-exchange-mediated Kondo screening is our main finding.\nFor such screening, \\eq{Tstar} is still fulfilled with very similar \nparameters, $a=0.37$ ($a=0.35$) and $b=1.51$ ($b=1.50$) for $U'=0$ ($U'=U/10$),\ncorrespondingly; see \\figs{G-T}(b-c).\nMoreover, as follows from \\eq{Jeff}, $U'$ reduces CAR exchange, and therefore diminishes $T^*$.\nFor the same values of $J^{\\mathrm{eff}}$, the dependence of $G(T)$ for $t=0$ and $\\GS{}>0$ is hardly different \nfrom the one for $\\GS{}=0$ and $t>0$ for $T\\geq T^*$ (results not shown).\nHowever, $G(T)$ saturates at residual value $G_{\\mathrm{min}}$ as $T\\to 0$ only for finite\n$\\GS{}$, which at particle-hole symmetry makes $G_{\\mathrm{min}}$\nthe hallmark of SC proximity and the corresponding CAR exchange processes.\nFrom numerical results, one can estimate it as\n\\begin{equation}\nG_{\\mathrm{min}} = \\frac{e^2}{h} \\cdot c \\, \\frac{\\GS{}^2}{U^2} \n\t\\qquad {\\scriptstyle (\\GS{1}=\\GS{2}=\\GS{})} ,\n\\label{Gmin}\n\\end{equation}\nwith $c\\approx 2.25$, barely depending on $U'$ and getting smaller for $t>0$. \nThis is illustrated in \\figs{G-T}(d-e), where the dotted line corresponds to \\eq{Gmin} with $c=2.25$. \n\nLastly, in \\fig{G-T}(a) we also present the curves obtained for $t=\\GS{}$ chosen such, \nthat the quantity $\\xi=\\sqrt{t^2+\\GS{}^2}$ remains the same \nin all the cases.\nThis is to illustrate what happens when \\emph{both} (direct and CAR) exchange interactions are\npresent. \\fig{G-T}(c) clearly shows that $T^*$ remains practically unaltered for $U'=0$.\nThe comparison with \\fig{G-T}(b) proves that in this case it practically does not depend \non $U'$. The enhancement of direct exchange is compensated by the decrease of the CAR one. \nOn the contrary, $G_{\\mathrm{min}}$ decreases for larger $t$ below the estimation given by Eq.~(\\ref{Gmin}), \nas can be seen in \\figs{G-T}(d-e). \n\nWhile analyzing the results concerning $G_{\\mathrm{min}}(\\GS{})$ plotted in \\figs{G-T}(d-e) \none needs to keep in mind that $G_{\\mathrm{min}}$ is obtained at deeply cryogenic conditions. To illustrate\nthis better, $G(\\GS{})$ obtained for $t=0$ and $T=10^{-6}U$ is plotted with solid line \nin \\fig{3}. Clearly, for weak $\\GS{}$ the system exhibits rather conventional (single-stage)\nKondo effect with $G=G_{\\mathrm{max}}\\approx 2e^2/h$, while QD2 is effectively decoupled ($G_{\\mathrm{max}}<2e^2/h$\nin the proximity of SC lead \\cite{KWIW}). Only for larger values of $\\GS{}$\nthe CAR exchange is strong enough, such that $T^*>T$ and the dependence $G(\\GS{})$ continuously \napproaches the $T=0$ limit estimated by \\eq{Gmin} and presented in \\figs{G-T}(d-e).\n\n\\section{CAR-RKKY competition}\n\\label{sec:RKKY}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.98\\linewidth]{Fig3.pdf}\n\\caption{Linear conductance $G$ vs. $\\GS{}$ calculated\n\t\t for $t=0$, $\\Gamma=U/5$, $U'=U/10$, finite $T=10^{-6}U$\n\t\t and different values of RKKY coupling $J$, as indicated. \n\t\t Inset shows QD1 spectral function $\\mathcal{A}(\\omega)$ as a function of energy $\\omega$\n\t\t for points on $J=-0.1U$ curve, indicated with corresponding symbols.\n\t\t}\n\\label{fig:3}\n\\end{figure}\n\nLet us now discuss the effects introduced by the conventional RKKY interaction.\nWe choose $t=0$ for the sake of simplicity and\nanalyze a wide range of $\\GS{}$, starting from the case of anti-ferromagnetic \nRKKY interaction ($J>0$). Large $J>0$ leads to the formation of a molecular singlet in the \nnanostructure. This suppresses the conductance, unless $\\GS{}$ becomes of the order of $U/2$, \nwhen the excited states of DQD are all close to the ground state. This is illustrated \nby double-dotted line in \\fig{3}.\nSmaller value of $J>0$ causes less dramatic consequences, namely it just increases $J^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ according\nto \\eq{Jeff}, leading to enhancement of $T^*$, cf. \\eq{Tstar}. This is presented with\ndot-dashed line in \\fig{3}.\n\nThe situation changes qualitatively for ferromagnetic RKKY coupling, $J<0$.\nThen, RKKY exchange and CAR exchange have opposite signs and compete with each other.\nDepending on their magnitudes and temperature, one\nof the following scenarios may happen.\n\nFor $J^{\\mathrm{eff}} > 0$, {\\it i.e.} large enough $\\GS{}$, and $T<T^*$, the system is in the \nsinglet state due to the two-stage Kondo screening of DQD spins. $G(T\\!=\\!0)$ is reduced \nto $G_{\\mathrm{min}}$, which tends to increase for large negative $J$; see dashed lines in \\fig{3}. \nIn the inset to \\fig{3}, the spectral density of QD1 representative for this regime is plotted \nas curve indicated by triangle. It corresponds to a point on the $J=-0.1U$ curve in the main \nplot, also indicated by triangle. The dip in $\\mathcal{A}(\\omega)$ has width of order of $T^*$.\n\nFor finite $T$, there is always a range of sufficiently small $|J^{\\mathrm{eff}}|$, where QD2 becomes effectively\ndecoupled, and, provided $T<T_K$, $G$ reaches $G_{\\mathrm{max}}$ due to conventional Kondo effect \nat QD1. This is the case for sufficiently small $\\GS{}$ for $J=0$ or $J=-0.01U$, and in the narrow\nrange of $\\GS{}$ around the point indicated by a circle in \\fig{3} for $J=-0.1U$ (for $J=0.01U$, \nthe considered $T$ is close to $T^*$ and $G$ does not reach $G_{\\rm max}$). The conventional Kondo effect manifests itself with \na characteristic peak in $\\mathcal{A}(\\omega)$, as illustrated in the inset in \\fig{3} with line denoted by circle.\n\nFinally, large enough $J^{\\mathrm{eff}} < 0$ and low $T$, give rise to an effective ferromagnetic coupling of DQDs \nspins into triplet state. Consequently, the underscreened Kondo effect occurs \n\\cite{Mattis,NozieresBlandin} for weak $\\GS{}$ and, {\\it e.g.}, $J=-0.1U$; \nsee the point indicated by square in \\fig{3}.\nThis leads to $G=G_{\\mathrm{max}}$ and a peak in $\\mathcal{A}(\\omega)$, whose shape is significantly different from the\nKondo peak, cf. the curve denoted by square in the inset in \\fig{3}. \n\n\n\n\\section{Effects of detuning from the particle-hole symmetry point}\n\\label{sec:asym}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.98\\linewidth]{Fig4.pdf}\n\\caption{\n         (a) Linear conductance between the normal leads $G$ as a function of temperature $T$\n         for parameters corresponding to \\fig{G-T}(a) with $\\xi=U/10$, and additional curves for finite \n         detuning from particle-hole symmetry point, $\\delta_1=-\\delta_2$, \n         and two values of $\\xi=\\sqrt{t^2+\\GS{}^2}$, as indicated in the figure.\n         (b) $G_{\\mathrm{min}} \\equiv G(T \\!=\\! 0)$ as a function of QD1 detuning $\\delta_1$ for different\n         exchange mechanisms, $\\xi=U/10$ and $\\delta_2=\\pm\\delta_1$ (as indicated).\n\t\t}\n\\label{fig:asym}\n\\end{figure}\n\nAt PHS $G_{\\mathrm{min}}=G(T \\!=\\! 0)=0$ in the absence of superconducting lead, making $G_{\\mathrm{min}} > 0$ a hallmark\nof SC-induced two-stage Kondo effect. However, outside of PHS point $G_{\\mathrm{min}} > 0$ even in the case of \nthe two-stage Kondo effect caused by the direct exchange. \nExact PHS conditions are hardly possible in real systems, and the fine-tuning of the QD energy\nlevels to PHS point is limited to some finite accuracy.\nTherefore, there may appear a question, if the results obtained at PHS are of any importance for the\nrealistic setups. As we show below --- they are,\nin a reasonable range of detunings $\\delta_i=\\varepsilon_i +U/2$.\n\nIn \\fig{asym}(a) we present the $G(T)$ dependence in and outside the PHS, corresponding to \nparameters of \\fig{G-T}(a). \nClearly, for considered small values of $\\delta_1=\\delta_2=\\delta$, \n$G_{\\mathrm{min}}<10^{-3}e^2/h$ for direct exchange only, while $G_{\\mathrm{min}}$ in the presence of a superconductor is \nsignificantly increased and close to the PHS value. Furthermore, for $|\\delta_1| \\sim |\\delta_2| \n\\sim \\delta$, the residual conductance caused by the lack of PHS, $G_{\\mathrm{min}} \\approx e^2/h \\cdot (\\delta/U)^2$,\nwhich is a rapidly decreasing function in the vicinity of PHS point, as illustrated in \\fig{asym}(b)\nwith lines denoted by a square. Evidently, in the regime $|\\delta_i| < 0.01U$ the residual conductance\ncaused by SC is orders of magnitude larger, leading to the plateau in $G_{\\mathrm{min}}(\\delta_1)$ dependence,\nvisible in \\fig{asym}(b).\nTaking into account that the realistic values of $U$ in the semiconductor quantum dots are rather \nlarge, this condition seems to be realizable by fine-tuning of QD gate voltages.\n\nLastly, let us point out that while in the presence of only one exchange mechanism, \\emph{CAR} or\n\\emph{direct}, $G_{\\mathrm{min}}(\\delta_1)$ dependencies depicted in \\fig{asym}(b) are symmetrical with respect\nto sign change of $\\delta_1$, for \\emph{both} exchange mechanisms the dependence is non-symmetric. \n\n\\section{Effects of asymmetry of couplings to superconductor}\n\\label{sec:x}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.98\\linewidth]{Fig5.pdf}\n\\caption{\n\t\t (a) Linear conductance between the normal leads, $G$, as a function of temperature, $T$,\n\t\t for parameters corresponding to \\fig{G-T}(a) with $\\xi=U/10$, for different values \n\t\t of asymmetry coefficient $x$ [see \\eq{xGS}], in the presence of \\emph{CAR} exchange only.\n\t\t %\n\t\t (b) The second-stage Kondo temperature $T^*$ normalized by $T_K$ as a function of $x$, \n\t\t calculated with the aid of NRG (points) and a fit to \\eq{Tstar} (lines) \n\t\t with $J^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ from \\eq{Jeff}.\n\t\t %\n\t\t (c) The zero-temperature conductance $G_{\\mathrm{min}}$ as a function of QD1 coupling to SC lead, $\\GS{1}$,\n\t\t compiled from data obtained at different circumstances (as indicated in the legend)\n\t\t for different $x$.

As shown below, it does not introduce any qualitatively new features.\nOn the other hand, it decreases the second stage Kondo temperature, which is already small, therefore,\nquantitative estimation of this decrease may be important for potential experimental approaches.\nTo analyze the effects of $\\GS{1}\\neq\\GS{2}$, we introduce the asymmetry parameter $x$ and extend\nthe definition of $\\GS{}$,\n\\beq\nx = \\frac{\\GS{1}-\\GS{2}}{\\GS{1}+\\GS{2}}, \\quad \\GS{} = \\frac{\\GS{1}+\\GS{2}}{2}.\n\\label{xGS}\n \\end{equation} \nNote, that even for a fixed $\\GS{}$, the actual CAR coupling $\\GS{\\rm X}=\\GS{}\\sqrt{1-x^2}$ decreases\nwith increasing $|x|$, which is a main mechanism leading to a decrease of $T^*$ outside the $x=0$ point\nvisible in \\figs{x}(a) and (b). To illustrate this, the curves corresponding to \\emph{both} exchange\nmechanisms were calculated using $x$-dependent $t=\\GS{\\rm X}$ instead of $t=\\xi/\\sqrt{2}$. \nTherefore, $\\xi$ was generalized for $x\\neq 0$ by setting $\\xi=\\sqrt{t^2(1-x^2)^{-1}+\\GS{}^2}$.\nClearly, in \\fig{x}(b) the curves for different exchange mechanisms are very similar and differ mainly \nby a constant factor, resulting from different influence of $U'$; see \\Sec{scales}. \nThe magnitude of $T^*$ changes is quite large, exceeding an order of magnitude for $x=\\pm 0.5$ \nand $\\xi=U/20$. Moreover, $T^* \\to 0$ for $x\\to\\pm 1$. Consequently, for strongly asymmetric\ndevices one cannot hope to observe the second stage of Kondo screening.\n\nA careful observer can note that the $T^*(x)$ dependency is not symmetrical; note for example different \n$T^*$ for $x=\\pm 0.5$ in \\fig{x}(a). This is caused by the dependence of the first stage Kondo temperature\n$T_K$ on $\\GS{1}$ \\cite{part1,DomanskiIW},\n\\beq\n\\widetilde{T}_K(\\GS{1}) = T_K \\cdot \\exp\\!\\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\frac{\\GS{1}^2}{\\Gamma U}\\right).\n \\end{equation} \nHere, $T_K$ is, as earlier, defined in the absence of SC, while $\\widetilde{T}_K$ is a function \nof $\\GS{1}$, such that $G(\\widetilde{T}_K) = G_{\\rm max}(\\GS{1})/2$ in the absence of QD2. \nAs $\\widetilde{T}_K$ grows for increasing $\\GS{1}$ (or $x$), $T^*$ decreases according to \\eq{Tstar}. \nIts $\\GS{}$ dependence can be accounted for by small changes in the coefficients $a$ and $b$ in \\eq{Tstar}, \nas long as $x$ is kept constant. \n\nTo close the discussion of $T^*(x)$ dependence let us point out, that in \\eq{A_J} \nthere appears a correction to \\eq{Jeff} for $x\\neq 0$. However, it is very small due to additional\nfactor $\\GS{}^2/U^2$ in the leading order. Its influence on curves plotted in \\fig{x}(b) is hardly visible.\n\nIn turn, let us examine the $x$ dependence of the $T=0$ conductance $G_{\\mathrm{min}}$. As can be seen \nin \\fig{x}(a), it monotonically increases with $x$, as it crosses $x=0$ point. In fact, \\eq{Gmin}\ncan be generalized to\n\\beq\nG_{\\mathrm{min}} = \\frac{e^2}{h} \\cdot c \\, \\frac{\\GS{1}^2}{U^2} ,\n\\label{Gmin2}\n \\end{equation} \nwith $c\\approx 2.25$ (indicated by a dotted line in \\fig{x}(c)). Note that $G_{\\mathrm{min}}$ is proportional to \n$\\GS{1}^2=(x+1)^2 \\GS{}^2$, instead of simply $\\GS{}$, cf. \\eq{Gmin}. The values of $G_{\\mathrm{min}}$ obtained\nfrom all analyzed $G(T)$ dependencies for different $x$ have been compiled in \\fig{x}(c).\nIt is evident, that \\eq{Gmin2} is approximately fulfilled for all the considered cases.\n\nFinally, it seems noteworthy that the normal-lead coupling asymmetry, \n$\\Gamma_{\\rm L}\\neq \\Gamma_{\\rm R}$, is irrelevant for the results except for a constant factor\ndiminishing the conductance $G$ \\cite{KWIWJB-asym}.\n\n\n\n\\section{The role of CAR efficiency}\n\\label{sec:coef}\n\n\\begin{figure}[tb]\n\\includegraphics[width=0.98\\linewidth]{Fig6.pdf}\n\\caption{Linear conductance between the normal leads\n\t\t $G$ as a function of coupling to SC lead, $\\GS{}$, for indicated values of RKKY exchange $J$\n\t\t and the efficiency of CAR processes reduced by factor (a) $\\mathcal{C}=0.9$ and (b) $\\mathcal{C}=0.5$.\n\t\t Other parameters as in \\fig{3}.\n\t\t Insets: QD1 local spectral density $\\mathcal{A}(\\omega)$ as a function of energy $\\omega$\n\t\t for points on $J=-0.1U$ curve, indicated with corresponding symbols.\n\t\t} \n\\label{fig:C}\n\\end{figure}\n\nUp to this point we assumed $\\GS{\\rm X} = \\sqrt{\\GS{1}\\GS{2}}$, which is valid when the two \nquantum dots are much closer to each other than the coherence length in the superconductor.\nThis does not have to be the case in real setups, yet relaxing this assumption does not \nintroduce qualitative changes. Nevertheless, the model cannot be extended to inter-dot \ndistances much larger than the coherence length, where $\\GS{\\rm X}\\to 0$.\n\nTo quantitatively analyze the consequences of less effective Andreev coupling we define the \nCAR efficiency as $\\mathcal{C} \\equiv \\GS{\\rm X} / \\sqrt{\\GS{1}\\GS{2}}$ and analyze $\\mathcal{C} < 1$\nin the wide range of $\\GS{1}=\\GS{2}=\\GS{}$ and other parameters corresponding to \\fig{3}. \nThe results are presented in \\fig{C}.\n\nClearly, decreasing $\\mathcal{C}$ from $\\mathcal{C}=1$ causes diminishing of $\\GS{\\rm X}$, and consequently of CAR \nexchange. For a change as small as $\\mathcal{C}=0.9$, the consequences reduce to some shift of the \nconventional Kondo regime, compare \\fig{C}(a) with \\fig{3}. Stronger suppression of CAR may, \nhowever, increase the SC coupling necessary to observe the second stage of Kondo screening caused\nby CAR outside the experimentally achievable range, see \\fig{C}(b). Moreover, the reduced $T^*$\nleads to narrowing of the related local spectral density dip, while the\nincreased critical $\\GS{}$ necessary for the observation of the second stage of screening leads to the\nshallowing of the dip. This is visible especially in the inset in \\fig{C}(b).\n\n\n\\section{Conclusions}\n\\label{sec:conclusions}\n\nThe CAR exchange mechanism is present in any system comprising at least\ntwo QDs or magnetic impurities coupled to the same superconducting contact\nin a way allowing for crossed Andreev reflections.\nIn the considered setup, comprised of two quantum dots in a T-shaped geometry \nwith respect to normal leads and proximized by superconductor,\nit leads to the two-stage Kondo\nscreening even in the absence of other exchange mechanisms.\nThis CAR induced exchange screening is characterized by a residual \nlow-temperature conductance at particle-hole symmetric case.\nWe have also shown that the competition between CAR exchange and RKKY\ninteraction may result in completely different Kondo screening scenarios.\n\nThe presented results bring further insight into the low-temperature\nbehavior of hybrid coupled quantum dot systems, which hopefully could be verified\nwith the present-day experimental techniques.\nMoreover, non-local pairing is present also in bulk systems such as non-$s$-wave superconductors.\nThe question if an analogue of discussed CAR exchange may play a role there\nseems intriguing in the context of tendencies of many strongly correlated materials\nto possess superconducting and anti-ferromagnetic phases.\n\n\n\\begin{acknowledgments}\nThis work was supported by the National Science Centre in Poland through project no.\n2015/19/N/ST3/01030.\nWe thank J.

Often disinformation is complied in the two major forms: fake news and propaganda, where they differ in the sense that the propaganda is possibly built upon true information (e.g., biased, loaded language, repetition, etc.).\nPrior works BIBREF0, BIBREF1, BIBREF2 in detecting propaganda have focused primarily at document level, typically labeling all articles from a propagandistic news outlet as propaganda and thus, often non-propagandistic articles from the outlet are mislabeled. To this end, EMNLP19DaSanMartino focuses on analyzing the use of propaganda and detecting specific propagandistic techniques in news articles at sentence and fragment level, respectively and thus, promotes explainable AI. For instance, the following text is a propaganda of type `slogan'.\nTrump tweeted: $\\underbrace{\\text{`}`{\\texttt {BUILD THE WALL!}\"}}_{\\text{slogan}}$\nShared Task: This work addresses the two tasks in propaganda detection BIBREF3 of different granularities: (1) Sentence-level Classification (SLC), a binary classification that predicts whether a sentence contains at least one propaganda technique, and (2) Fragment-level Classification (FLC), a token-level (multi-label) classification that identifies both the spans and the type of propaganda technique(s).\nContributions: (1) To address SLC, we design an ensemble of different classifiers based on Logistic Regression, CNN and BERT, and leverage transfer learning benefits using the pre-trained embeddings/models from FastText and BERT. We also employed different features such as linguistic (sentiment, readability, emotion, part-of-speech and named entity tags, etc.), layout, topics, etc. (2) To address FLC, we design a multi-task neural sequence tagger based on LSTM-CRF and linguistic features to jointly detect propagandistic fragments and its type. Moreover, we investigate performing FLC and SLC jointly in a multi-granularity network based on LSTM-CRF and BERT. (3) Our system (MIC-CIS) is ranked 3rd (out of 12 participants) and 4th (out of 25 participants) in FLC and SLC tasks, respectively.\nSystem Description ::: Linguistic, Layout and Topical Features\nSome of the propaganda techniques BIBREF3 involve word and phrases that express strong emotional implications, exaggeration, minimization, doubt, national feeling, labeling , stereotyping, etc. This inspires us in extracting different features (Table TABREF1) including the complexity of text, sentiment, emotion, lexical (POS, NER, etc.), layout, etc. To further investigate, we use topical features (e.g., document-topic proportion) BIBREF4, BIBREF5, BIBREF6 at sentence and document levels in order to determine irrelevant themes, if introduced to the issue being discussed (e.g., Red Herring).\nFor word and sentence representations, we use pre-trained vectors from FastText BIBREF7 and BERT BIBREF8.\nSystem Description ::: Sentence-level Propaganda Detection\nFigure FIGREF2 (left) describes the three components of our system for SLC task: features, classifiers and ensemble. The arrows from features-to-classifier indicate that we investigate linguistic, layout and topical features in the two binary classifiers: LogisticRegression and CNN. For CNN, we follow the architecture of DBLP:conf/emnlp/Kim14 for sentence-level classification, initializing the word vectors by FastText or BERT. We concatenate features in the last hidden layer before classification.\nOne of our strong classifiers includes BERT that has achieved state-of-the-art performance on multiple NLP benchmarks. Following DBLP:conf/naacl/DevlinCLT19, we fine-tune BERT for binary classification, initializing with a pre-trained model (i.e., BERT-base, Cased). Additionally, we apply a decision function such that a sentence is tagged as propaganda if prediction probability of the classifier is greater than a threshold ($\\tau $). We relax the binary decision boundary to boost recall, similar to pankajgupta:CrossRE2019.\nEnsemble of Logistic Regression, CNN and BERT: In the final component, we collect predictions (i.e., propaganda label) for each sentence from the three ($\\mathcal {M}=3$) classifiers and thus, obtain $\\mathcal {M}$ number of predictions for each sentence. We explore two ensemble strategies (Table TABREF1): majority-voting and relax-voting to boost precision and recall, respectively.\nSystem Description ::: Fragment-level Propaganda Detection\nFigure FIGREF2 (right) describes our system for FLC task, where we design sequence taggers BIBREF9, BIBREF10 in three modes: (1) LSTM-CRF BIBREF11 with word embeddings ($w\\_e$) and character embeddings $c\\_e$, token-level features ($t\\_f$) such as polarity, POS, NER, etc. (2) LSTM-CRF+Multi-grain that jointly performs FLC and SLC with FastTextWordEmb and BERTSentEmb, respectively.

(3) LSTM-CRF+Multi-task that performs propagandistic span/fragment detection (PFD) and FLC (fragment detection + 19-way classification).\nEnsemble of Multi-grain, Multi-task LSTM-CRF with BERT: Here, we build an ensemble by considering propagandistic fragments (and its type) from each of the sequence taggers. In doing so, we first perform majority voting at the fragment level for the fragment where their spans exactly overlap. In case of non-overlapping fragments, we consider all. However, when the spans overlap (though with the same label), we consider the fragment with the largest span.\nExperiments and Evaluation\nData: While the SLC task is binary, the FLC consists of 18 propaganda techniques BIBREF3. We split (80-20%) the annotated corpus into 5-folds and 3-folds for SLC and FLC tasks, respectively. The development set of each the folds is represented by dev (internal); however, the un-annotated corpus used in leaderboard comparisons by dev (external). We remove empty and single token sentences after tokenization. Experimental Setup: We use PyTorch framework for the pre-trained BERT model (Bert-base-cased), fine-tuned for SLC task. In the multi-granularity loss, we set $\\alpha = 0.1$ for sentence classification based on dev (internal, fold1) scores. We use BIO tagging scheme of NER in FLC task. For CNN, we follow DBLP:conf/emnlp/Kim14 with filter-sizes of [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 128 filters and 16 batch-size. We compute binary-F1and macro-F1 BIBREF12 in SLC and FLC, respectively on dev (internal).\nExperiments and Evaluation ::: Results: Sentence-Level Propaganda\nTable TABREF10 shows the scores on dev (internal and external) for SLC task. Observe that the pre-trained embeddings (FastText or BERT) outperform TF-IDF vector representation. In row r2, we apply logistic regression classifier with BERTSentEmb that leads to improved scores over FastTextSentEmb. Subsequently, we augment the sentence vector with additional features that improves F1 on dev (external), however not dev (internal). Next, we initialize CNN by FastTextWordEmb or BERTWordEmb and augment the last hidden layer (before classification) with BERTSentEmb and feature vectors, leading to gains in F1 for both the dev sets. Further, we fine-tune BERT and apply different thresholds in relaxing the decision boundary, where $\\tau \\ge 0.35$ is found optimal.\nWe choose the three different models in the ensemble: Logistic Regression, CNN and BERT on fold1 and subsequently an ensemble+ of r3, r6 and r12 from each fold1-5 (i.e., 15 models) to obtain predictions for dev (external). We investigate different ensemble schemes (r17-r19), where we observe that the relax-voting improves recall and therefore, the higher F1 (i.e., 0.673). In postprocess step, we check for repetition propaganda technique by computing cosine similarity between the current sentence and its preceding $w=10$ sentence vectors (i.e., BERTSentEmb) in the document. If the cosine-similarity is greater than $\\lambda \\in \\lbrace .99, .95\\rbrace $, then the current sentence is labeled as propaganda due to repetition. Comparing r19 and r21, we observe a gain in recall, however an overall decrease in F1 applying postprocess.\nFinally, we use the configuration of r19 on the test set. The ensemble+ of (r4, r7 r12) was analyzed after test submission. Table TABREF9 (SLC) shows that our submission is ranked at 4th position.\nExperiments and Evaluation ::: Results: Fragment-Level Propaganda\nTable TABREF11 shows the scores on dev (internal and external) for FLC task. Observe that the features (i.e., polarity, POS and NER in row II) when introduced in LSTM-CRF improves F1. We run multi-grained LSTM-CRF without BERTSentEmb (i.e., row III) and with it (i.e., row IV), where the latter improves scores on dev (internal), however not on dev (external). Finally, we perform multi-tasking with another auxiliary task of PFD. Given the scores on dev (internal and external) using different configurations (rows I-V), it is difficult to infer the optimal configuration. Thus, we choose the two best configurations (II and IV) on dev (internal) set and build an ensemble+ of predictions (discussed in section SECREF6), leading to a boost in recall and thus an improved F1 on dev (external).\nFinally, we use the ensemble+ of (II and IV) from each of the folds 1-3, i.e., $|{\\mathcal {M}}|=6$ models to obtain predictions on test. Table TABREF9 (FLC) shows that our submission is ranked at 3rd position.\nConclusion and Future Work\nOur system (Team: MIC-CIS) explores different neural architectures (CNN, BERT and LSTM-CRF) with linguistic, layout and topical features to address the tasks of fine-grained propaganda detection. We have demonstrated gains in performance due to the features, ensemble schemes, multi-tasking and multi-granularity architectures. Compared to the other participating systems, our submissions are ranked 3rd and 4th in FLC and SLC tasks, respectively.\nIn future, we would like to enrich BERT models with linguistic, layout and topical features during their fine-tuning. Further, we would also be interested in understanding and analyzing the neural network learning, i.e., extracting salient fragments (or key-phrases) in the sentence that generate propaganda, similar to pankajgupta:2018LISA in order to promote explainable AI.", "full_doc_id": "doc-5970d734ccb10451fc2aa2d2d5e77155", "file_path": "unknown_source"}, {"__id__": "chunk-839b9269faad834f312b90102dcfe061", "__created_at__": 1742539999.219114, "content": "Bare Acts Live\nHimachal Pradesh Town and Country Planning Act, 1977\nHimachal Pradesh Town And Country Planning Rules, 1978\n3.

Our approach is based on applying an optimal \"denoiser\" after the action of a noisy circuit and can be performed with an arbitrary number of extra gates.\nThe denoiser is given by an ensemble of circuits distributed with a quasiprobability distribution. For a simple noise model, we show that efficient, local denoisers can be found, and we demonstrate their effectiveness for the digital quantum simulation of the time evolution of simple spin chains. Introduction.\n-Quantum information processing has been theoretically shown to hold great promises, and quantum algorithms were developed which can in principle achieve an exponential speed-up over their classical counterparts, both for general purpose computing and quantum simulation . However, present day quantum computing prototypes still suffer from significant noise processes which hinder the execution of many potentially groundbreaking quantum algorithms .\nNontrivial quantum algorithms typically require large sequences of quantum gates, each of which introduces dissipation and hence an overall loss of coherence, eventually rendering the results useless. Until quantum error correction becomes practical, quantum error mitigation seems to be more feasible to increase the accuracy of expectation values.\nHere the goal is to induce the (partial) cancellation of errors that stem from noisy quantum gates by extending the circuit corresponding to the desired algorithm with an ensemble of gates , sampled from a quasiprobability distribution. The traditional way to accomplish this is with the gatewise method from , where noise is mitigated by inverting the noise channel of each gate separately, i.e. the cancellation of errors is performed for each gate on its own.\nHere the local noise channel is approximated in a way such that it can be easily inverted analytically, e.g. using Pauli twirling . Gates are then sampled from the inverted noise channel by interpreting it as a quasiprobability distribution. Because in this gate-wise approach every noisy gate has to be modified separately, the sign problem is exponentially large in the number of gates, limiting the practicality of the mitigation.\nThe success of the gate-wise approach resulted in a large body of work concerning these methods , including extensions for simultaneous mitigation of multiple gates by Pauli-twirling entire layers or variationally constructing a mitigating matrix product operator . In principle, errors during the execution of a circuit can propagate and accumulate.\nThese propagated errors * david.luitz@uni-bonn.de ≈ C\n\nC\n\nFIG. 1. An example of the quantum error mitigation procedure used in this work for the time evolution of the wave function of a spin chain. The ideal second-order Trotter supercircuit C of depth Mtrot = 1 (light blue) is approximated by applying a denoiser D of depth M = 1 (red) to the noisy Trotter supercircuit C (dark blue).\nBecause the denoiser is applied after fully executing the noisy Trotter supercircuit, it represents an approximate inverse of the global noise channel with a precision tunable by the depth of the denoiser. can potentially blow up and lead to large errors for the circuit as a whole . Here we introduce a mitigation technique that takes into account the propagation of errors, can be performed with a tunable number of extra gates, and works for non-Clifford local noise channels since the inversion of the accumulated global noise channel is implicit.\nWe first execute the targeted noisy circuit completely, letting the noise propagate and accumulate, and only afterwards we apply an extra random circuit sampled from a quasiprobability distribution. We call the corresponding ensemble of random circuits a denoiser, and we construct it such that upon averaging the accumulated errors cancel.\nEssentially, the denoiser inverts a global noise channel. Since we will construct it as a local brickwall circuit, following the classical preprocessing approach from , we call this compressed quantum error mitigation. Method. -Due to the inevitable coupling of a quantum processor to its environment, every qubit operation is affected by noise.\nTherefore, the simplest technique to minimize the impact of the resulting noise is to minimize the number of operations when performing a quantum algorithm. In we showed that many-body time evolution operators can be efficiently compressed into brick-wall circuits with high fidelity per gate. In this Letter, we consider the noise explicitly by treating quantum operations as (generally non-unitary) quantum channels, corresponding to completely positive and trace preserving (CPTP) maps .\nFor example, instead of a noiseless two-qubit gate G, which acts on a quantum state |ρ in superoperator form as G|ρ = G⊗G * |ρ , we get the noisy channel G = N G, where the noise channel N implements the two-qubit noise . These channels are used to construct a \"supercircuit\" C = N G i=1 Gi , consisting of N G channels, which is affected by multi-qubit accumulated noise.\nThis supercircuit encodes an ensemble of circuits . For simplicity, we assume that the noisy channels Gi in each half brickwall layer are lattice inversion and translation invariant, such that we can construct a denoiser with these properties, limiting the number of variational parameters. The purpose of quantum error mitigation is to modify the ensemble of circuits described by C in a way that we can use it to obtain the noiseless expectation values.\nIn superoperator language, we do this by following the supercircuit C with a denoiser supercircuit D, such that D C is as close to the noiseless supercircuit C = C ⊗ C * as possible. Here C is the target unitary circuit. Because the noise channel N is non-unitary, hence making the supercircuit C non-unitary, we need to use a non-unitary denoiser to retrieve the unitary C.\nWe illustrate the mitigation procedure in Fig. , where a denoiser with one layer is used to mitigate errors for a second-order Trotter supercircuit with one layer. This circuit architecture is commonly used to simulate the time evolution of a quantum many-body system, until some time t, with controllable precision , and we will use it to benchmark the denoiser.\nIn practice, we cannot directly implement a supercircuit, and so we have to utilize its interpretation as an ensemble of circuits. Essentially, after executing a shot of the noisy circuit we sample the denoiser and apply it. The goal is to construct the denoiser in a way that averaging over many of its samples cancels the accumulated errors and gives us a good approximation of the noiseless expectation values.\nIt should be noted that our approach requires more gate applications on the quantum processor than with the gate-wise scheme, since there each sample from the mitigation quasiprobability distribution can be absorbed into the original circuit, whereas our approach increases the circuit depth. We take this into account by imposing the same noise on the denoiser.\nFurthermore, within our scheme, the dimensionality of the quasiprobabilistic mitigating ensemble can be controlled, in contrast to the gate-wise approach where it is equal to the gate count. To facilitate the stochastic interpretation we parameterize each two-qubit denoiser channel G i as a sum of CPTP maps, such that we can sample the terms in this sum and execute the sampled gate on the quantum processor.\nConcretely, we use a trace preserv-ing sum of a unitary and a non-unitary channel. For the unitary part we take a two-qubit unitary channel U( φ i ) = U ( φ i ) ⊗ U * ( φ i ), with U ( φ i ) a two-qubit unitary gate parameterized by φ i . For this we take the two-qubit ZZ rotation exp(−iα(σ z ⊗ σ z )) with angle α, which can be obtained from native gates on current hardware , and dress it with four general one-qubit unitaries, only two of which are independent if we want a circuit that is space inversion symmetric around every bond.\nThe resulting gate has 7 real parameters φ i . For the non-unitary part, which is essential because D has to cancel the non-unitary accumulated noise to obtain the noiseless unitary circuit, we use a general onequbit measurement followed by conditional preparation channel M( , with V a general one-qubit unitary and each κ i a 3-dimensional vector, resulting in a real 9-dimensional ζ i .\nThis yields the two-qubit correlated measurement M( With these parts we construct the parameterization with coefficients η i ∈ R that satisfy η 0 + η 1 = 1 because G i is trace preserving. Note that here the tensor product symbol corresponds to combining two one-qubit channels to make a two-qubit channel, whereas in most of the paper it is used to link the column and row indices of a density matrix.\nWe construct the denoiser from the noisy channels Gi = N G i . With this parameterization one denoiser channel has 17 independent real parameters, such that a denoiser of depth M , i.e. consisting of M brickwall layers, has 34M real parameters (we use one unique channel per half brickwall layer). For reference, a general channel has 544M parameters.\nTo determine the mitigated expectation values we use the full expression where |ρ 0 is the initial state and |1 is the vectorized identity operator on the full Hilbert space. To evaluate this on a quantum processor, we use the stochastic interpretation of (1) to resample . In particular, from each channel (1) we get a unitary with probability p 0 = |η 0 |/γ and a measurement followed by conditional preparation with probability p 1 = |η 1 |/γ.\nHere γ = |η 0 | + |η 1 | is the sampling overhead, which characterizes the magnitude of the sign problem from negative η i . For quasiprobability distributions, i.e. with γ > 1, every denoiser sample has an extra sign sgn(η) = N G g=1 sgn(η g ), 2. The normalized distance between the denoised Trotter supercircuit D C and the noiseless Trotter supercircuit C (top panels), at evolution times t = 0.5, 1, ..., 5, and the twopoint z-spin correlator C zz i=L/2,j=L/2 (t) of a spin on the middle site at times 0 and t (bottom panels), for the infinite temperature initial state.\nWe consider denoisers with depths M = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and second-order Trotter circuits with depths Mtrot = 16, 32, 64. In the top panels we use a Heisenberg chain with L = 8, and in the bottom panels with L = 14, both with periodic boundary conditions. All gates are affected by two-qubit depolarizing noise with p = 0.01.\nThe non-denoised results are labelled with M = 0, and the noiseless values with p = 0. where sgn(η g ) is the sign of the sampled coefficient of the gth channel. γ = 1 means that all signs are positive. Observables Ô p=0 for the noiseless circuit are then approximated by resampling the observables from the denoiser ensemble\nwhere γ = N G g=1 γ g is the overall sampling overhead, with γ g the overhead of the gth gate. Clearly, a large γ implies a large variance of Ô p=0 for a given number of samples, with accurate estimation requiring the cancellation of large signed terms. The number of samples required to resolve this cancellation of signs is bounded by Hoeffding's inequality, which states that a sufficient number of samples to estimate Ô p=0 with error δ at probability 1 − ω is bounded by (2γ 2 /δ 2 ) ln(2/ω) .\nSince γ scales exponentially in γ g , it is clear that a denoiser with large M and γ 1 will require many samples. We observed that decompositions with γ > 1 are crucial for an accurate denoiser. Restricting to γ = 1 leads to large infidelity and no improvement upon increasing the number of terms in or the depth M of the denoiser.\nSimply put, probabilistic error cancellation of gate noise introduces a sign problem and it is crucial to find optimal parameterizations (1) which minimize γ to make the approach scalable. This issue arises in all high performance error mitigation schemes , because the inverse of a physical noise channel is unphysical and cannot be represented as a positive sum over CPTP maps.\nThis is clearly visible in the spectra of the denoiser, which lies outside the unit circle (cf. Fig. ). This makes the tunability of the number of gates in each denoiser sample a crucial ingredient, which allows control over the sign problem, because we can freely choose the η i in . For the parametrization (1) of denoiser channels, we try to find a set of parameters for error mitigation by minimizing the normalized Frobenius distance between the noiseless and denoised supercircuits\nwhich bounds the distance of output density matrices and becomes zero for perfect denoising. We carry out the minimization of on a classical processor, using gradient descent with the differential programming algorithm from . Instead of explicitly calculating the accumulated global noise channel and subsequently inverting it, we approximate the noiseless supercircuit C with the denoised supercircuit D C, effectively yielding a circuit representation D of the inverse noise channel.\nResults. -To benchmark the denoiser we apply it to the second-order Trotter circuits of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain with periodic boundary conditions (PBC) where is the Pauli algebra acting on the local Hilbert space of site i. A second-order Trotter circuit for evolution time t with depth M trot consists of M trot − 1 half brickwall layers with time step t/M trot and two layers with half time step .\nWe consider circuits that are affected by uniform depolarizing noise with probability p for simplicity, but our approach can be used for any non-Clifford noise. The two-qubit noise channel is which acts on neighboring qubits i and i + 1 and is applied to each Trotter and denoiser gate, and p = 0.01 unless stated otherwise.\nWe study circuits with depths M trot = 16, 32, 64 for evolution times t = 0.5, 1, ..., 5, and denoisers D with depths M = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8. In the top panels of Fig. we show (4) for a chain of size L = 8 as a function of time t. Here it can be seen that even for M trot = 32 a denoiser with M = 1 already improves by roughly an order of magnitude at all considered t.\nDepending on M trot and t, further increasing M lowers , with the biggest improvements occurring for high precision Trotter circuits with large depth M trot = 64 and short time t = 0.5, where the Trotter gates are closer to the identity than in the other cases. At the other extreme, for M trot = 16 the improvements are relatively small upon increasing M > 2. In all cases the denoiser works better at early times than at late times, again indicating that it is easier to denoise Trotter gates that are relatively close to the identity.\nTo probe the accuracy of the denoiser on quantities that do not enter the optimization, as a first test we consider the two-point correlator between spins at different times where we have chosen the infinite temperature initial state, and C(t) is the Trotter supercircuit for time t. In the bottom panels of Fig. we show C zz i=L/2,j=L/2 (t) for the supercircuits from the upper panels, now for a L = 14 chain.\nHere we see that at M trot = 16 we can retrieve the noiseless values already with M = 1, but that increasing M trot makes this more difficult. At M trot = 64 we see larger deviations, and improvement upon increasing M is less stable, but nonetheless we are able to mitigate errors to a large extent. As a further test, we compute the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) ]\nIn Fig. we show the results for i = L/2, for a Trotter circuit with depth M trot = 32 and a denoiser with depth M = 2. Here we see that a denoiser with M M trot is able to recover the light-cone of correlations, which are otherwise buried by the noise. In the Supplementary Material we consider how the denoiser performs at different noise levels p, and how the denoised supercircuits perform under stacking.\nThere we also calculate domain wall magnetization dynamics, and show the distribution of the optimized denoiser parameters and the sampling overhead associated to the denoiser as a whole. In Fig. we show the eigenvalues of the noisy supercircuits for a noisy second-order Trotter supercircuit with M trot = 16 at t = 1 (left), the corresponding optimized denoiser with M = 4 (center), and the denoised supercircuit (right).\nThe eigenvalues λ of a unitary supercircuit lie on the unit circle, and in the presence of dissipation they are pushed to the center. We see that the spectrum of the denoiser lies outside the unit circle, making it an unphysical channel which cures the effect of the noise on the circuit, such that the spectrum of the denoised circuit is pushed back to the unit circle.\nThe noiseless eigenvalues are shown as blue bars, making it clear that the denoiser is able to recover the noiseless eigenvalues from the noisy circuit. In the Supplementary Material we show the spectra for a p = 0.036 denoiser, where we observe a clustering of eigenvalues reminiscent of Refs. . There we also investigate the channel entropy of the various supercircuits .\nConclusion. -We have introduced a probabilistic error cancellation scheme, where a classically determined denoiser mitigates the accumulated noise of a (generally non-Clifford) local noise channel. The required number of mitigation gates, i.e. the dimensionality of the corresponding quasiprobability distribution, is tunable and the parameterization of the corresponding channels provides control over the sign problem that is inherent to probabilistic error cancellation.\nWe have shown that a denoiser with one layer can already significantly mitigate errors for second-order Trotter circuits with up to 64 layers. This effectiveness of low-depth compressed circuits for denoising, in contrast with the noiseless time evolution operator compression from , can be understood from the non-unitarity of the denoiser channels.\nIn particu-lar, measurements can have non-local effects, since the measurement of a single qubit can reduce some highly entangled state (e.g. a GHZ state) to a product state, whereas in unitary circuits the spreading of correlations forms a light-cone. To optimize a denoiser with convenience at L > 8, the optimization can be formulated in terms of matrix product operators or channels , which is convenient because the circuit calculations leading to the normalized distance and its gradient are easily formulated in terms of tensor contractions and singular value decompositions .\nThis provides one route to a practical denoiser, which is relevant because the targeted noiseless circuit and the accompanying noisy variant in (4) need to be simulated classically, confining the optimization procedure to limited system sizes with an exact treatment or limited entanglement with tensor networks.\nNonetheless, we can use e.g. matrix product operators to calculate (4) for some relatively small t, such that the noiseless and denoised supercircuits in (4) have relatively small entanglement, and then stack the final denoised supercircuit on a quantum processor to generate classically intractable states.\nAnalogously, we can optimize the channels exactly at some classically tractable size and then execute them on a quantum processor with larger size. Both approaches are limited by the light-cone of many-body correlations, as visualized in Fig. , because finite-size effects appear when the light-cone width becomes comparable with system size.\n1. The normalized distance (left) and z spin correlator C zz i=L/2,j=L/2 (right), for a second-order Trotter supercircuit of depth Mtrot = 16 for time t = 1, affected by various twoqubit depolarizing errors p. We compare the values obtained with and without a denoiser, i.e. M > 0 and M = 0, to the noiseless values (p = 0).\nThe denoiser is affected by the same noise as the Trotter circuit. We consider denoisers with depths M = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and we use a L = 8 Heisenberg chain with PBC for the normalized distance, while for the correlator we use L = 14. * david.luitz@uni-bonn.de to observe that even for larger noise strength p, the local observable C zz improves significantly even with denoisers of depth M = 1.\nFor large noise strengths, we generally see that the optimization of the denoiser becomes difficult, leading to nonmonotonic behavior as a function of p, presumably because we do not find the global optimum of the denoiser. It is interesting to analyze the spectra of the supercircuits considered in this work.\nAs mentioned in the main text, the spectrum of the ideal, unitary supercircuit C lies on the unit circle. The comparison to this case is therefore instructive. In the main text, we showed an example of the spectra in Fig. for moderate noise strength. Here, we show additional data for stronger noise p = 0.036 in Fig. for a denoiser with M = 4 layers, optimized to mitigate errors for a second-order Trotter supercircuit with M trot = 16 layers at time t = 1.\nThe eigenvalues λ of the noisy supercircuit C are clustered close to zero, far away from the unit circle (except for λ = 1), showing that the circuit is strongly affected by the noise. To mitigate the impact of the noise, the denoiser consequently has to renormalize the spectrum strongly. If it accurately represents the inverse of the global noise channel, its spectrum has to lie far outside the unit circle, which is the case.\nInterestingly, we observe a clustering of eigenvalues which is reminiscent to the spectra found in . By comparison to these works, we suspect that this is due to the local nature of the denoiser, and warrants further investigation. The right panel of Fig. shows the result of the denoiser, pushing the eigenvalues back to the unit circle, nearly with the exact same distribution along the circle as the noiseless eigenvalues (blue bars).\nDue to the strong noise, this is not achieved perfectly, and it is clear that this cannot work in principle if the global noise channel has a zero eigenvalue. The complexity of an operator can be quantified by its operator entanglement entropy . Here we calculate the half-chain channel entanglement entropy S of the noiseless C, noisy C, denoiser D, and denoised D C supercircuits.\nWe define S as the entanglement entropy of the state that is related to a supercircuit C via the Choi-Jamio lkowski isomorphism, i.e. ψ C = χ C /N , where the process matrix χ ab,cd C = C ac,bd is simply a reshaped supercircuit and N ensures normalization. Then we have S = −Tr [ψ C ln ψ C ]. This entropy measure is a particular instance of the \"exchange entropy\", which characterizes the information exchange between a quantum system and its environment .\nIn Fig. we plot the various S for a second-order Trotter circuit with M trot = 16 at t = 2, for a denoiser with M = 4, both affected by two-qubit depolarizing noise with p ∈ [10 −3 , 10 −1 ]. The Trotter circuit is for a Heisenberg model with L = 6 and PBC. We see that at large p, the noise destroys entanglement in the noisy supercircuit, and that the denoiser S increases to correct for this, such that the denoised supercircuit recovers the noiseless S.\nHere we investigate how denoised supercircuits perform upon repeated application. We optimize the denoiser for a Trotter supercircuit for a fixed evolution time t. Then, to reach later times, we stack the denoised supercircuit n times to approximate the evolution up to time nt: In Fig. we stack a denoised t = 1 supercircuit up to n = 20 times and calculate the correlation function, defined in the main text, for the middle site.\nWe consider Trotter depths M trot = 8, 16, 32, 64 and denoiser depths M = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, for a L = 14 Heisenberg chain with p = 0.01 depolarizing two-qubit noise. The noisy results correspond to M = 0 and the noiseless results to p = 0. In Fig. we calculate the OTOC, defined in the main text, with stacked time evolution for a denoised t = 2 supercircuit with M trot = 32 and M = 2, stacked up to ten times.\nWe see that the stacked supercircuit performs very well, and the additional precision obtained by using deep denoisers (M = 8) pays off for long evolution times, where we see convergence to the exact result (black dashed lines in Fig. ) as a function of M . FIG. . The two-point z-spin correlator C zz i=L/2,j=L/2 (t) of a spin on the middle site at times 0 and t, for the infinite temperature initial state, for denoised second-order Trotter supercircuits that are optimized at evolution time t = 1 and then stacked up to twenty times.\nWe use Trotter depths Mtrot = 8, 16, 32, 64 and denoiser depths M = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8. The calculations were performed for a periodic Heisenberg model with L = 14 and PBC, affected by two-qubit depolarizing noise with strength p = 0.01, which also affects the denoiser. The non-denoised results are labelled with M = 0, and the noiseless results with p = 0.\nThe panels are arranged as Mtrot = 8, 16, 32, 64 for top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right, respectively. The costliest and most noise-susceptible operation is the two-qubit ZZ rotation with angle α, which is the foundation of the unitary piece in our channel parameterization, defined in the main text.\nFor completeness, we here present the α angles of the optimized denoisers. The results are shown in Fig. , which contains histograms for the channel count N G versus α. The histograms are stacked, with the lightest color corresponding to the angles of the denoiser at t = 0.5 and the darkest at t = 5. The top four panels are for a denoiser with M = 2 and the bottom four with M = 8.\nWe consider M trot = 8, 16, 32, 64. We see that in both cases the distribution widens upon increasing M trot , indicating that the unitary channels start deviating more from the identity. Moreover, while the M = 2 denoisers in all cases except M trot = 64 have ZZ contributions close to the identity, this is clearly not the case for M = 8.\nFor simplicity, we did not focus on obtaining denoisers with the smallest sampling overhead γ, which is required to minimize the sign problem and hence ease the sampling of mitigated quantities. Instead, we let the optimization freely choose the η i in the denoiser parameterization, as defined in the main text.\nIn Fig. we show the sampling overhead of the denoisers from Fig. of the main text. We see that for M = 1 and M = 2 the sampling overhead is relatively small and uniform across the different t, whereas for M > 2 the optimization sometimes yields a denoiser with large γ and other times with small γ. This could be related to the difference in α distributions from Fig. .\nThe large fluctuations of γ appears to stem from the difficulty in finding optimal deep denoisers, and our optimization procedure likely only finds a local minimum in these cases. Here C(t) is the Trotter supercircuit for time t.

However, practitioners looking to build QA systems for specific applications may not have the resources to collect tens of thousands of questions on corpora of their choice. At the same time, state-of-the-art machine reading systems do not lend well to low-resource QA settings where the number of labeled question-answer pairs are limited (c.f. Table 2 ). Semi-supervised QA methods like BIBREF0 aim to improve this performance by leveraging unlabeled data which is easier to collect.\nIn this work, we present a semi-supervised QA system which requires the end user to specify a set of base documents and only a small set of question-answer pairs over a subset of these documents. Our proposed system consists of three stages. First, we construct cloze-style questions (predicting missing spans of text) from the unlabeled corpus; next, we use the generated clozes to pre-train a powerful neural network model for extractive QA BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 ; and finally, we fine-tune the model on the small set of provided QA pairs.\nOur cloze construction process builds on a typical writing phenomenon and document structure: an introduction precedes and summarizes the main body of the article. Many large corpora follow such a structure, including Wikipedia, academic papers, and news articles. We hypothesize that we can benefit from the un-annotated corpora to better answer various questions – at least ones that are lexically similar to the content in base documents and directly require factual information.\nWe apply the proposed system on three datasets from different domains – SQuAD BIBREF3 , TriviaQA-Web BIBREF4 and the BioASQ challenge BIBREF5 . We observe significant improvements in a low-resource setting across all three datasets. For SQuAD and TriviaQA, we attain an F1 score of more than 50% by merely using 1% of the training data. Our system outperforms the approaches for semi-supervised QA presented in BIBREF0 , and a baseline which uses the same unlabeled data but with a language modeling objective for pretraining. In the BioASQ challenge, we outperform the best performing system from previous year's challenge, improving over a baseline which does transfer learning from the SQuAD dataset. Our analysis reveals that questions which ask for factual information and match to specific parts of the context documents benefit the most from pretraining on automatically constructed clozes.\nRelated Work\nSemi-supervised learning augments the labeled dataset $L$ with a potentially larger unlabeled dataset $U$ . BIBREF0 presented a model, GDAN, which trained an auxiliary neural network to generate questions from passages by reinforcement learning, and augment the labeled dataset with the generated questions to train the QA model. Here we use a much simpler heuristic to generate the auxiliary questions, which also turns out to be more effective as we show superior performance compared to GDAN. Several approaches have been suggested for generating natural questions BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 , however none of them show a significant improvement of using the generated questions in a semi-supervised setting. Recent papers also use unlabeled data for QA by training large language models and extracting contextual word vectors from them to input to the QA model BIBREF9 , BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 . The applicability of this method in the low-resource setting is unclear as the extra inputs increase the number of parameters in the QA model, however, our pretraining can be easily applied to these models as well.\nDomain adaptation (and Transfer learning) leverage existing large scale datasets from a source domain (or task) to improve performance on a target domain (or task). For deep learning and QA, a common approach is to pretrain on the source dataset and then fine-tune on the target dataset BIBREF12 , BIBREF13 . BIBREF14 used SQuAD as a source for the target BioASQ dataset, and BIBREF15 used Book Test BIBREF16 as source for the target SQuAD dataset. BIBREF17 transfer learned model layers from the tasks of sequence labeling, text classification and relation classification to show small improvements on SQuAD. All these works use manually curated source datatset, which in themselves are expensive to collect. Instead, we show that it is possible to automatically construct the source dataset from the same domain as the target, which turns out to be more beneficial in terms of performance as well (c.f. Section \"Experiments & Results\" ). Several cloze datasets have been proposed in the literature which use heuristics for construction BIBREF18 , BIBREF19 , BIBREF20 . We further see the usability of such a dataset in a semi-supervised setting.\nMethodology\nOur system comprises of following three steps:\nCloze generation: Most of the documents typically follow a template, they begin with an introduction that provides an overview and a brief summary for what is to follow. We assume such a structure while constructing our cloze style questions. When there is no clear demarcation, we treat the first $K\\%$ (hyperparameter, in our case 20%) of the document as the introduction. While noisy, this heuristic generates a large number of clozes given any corpus, which we found to be beneficial for semi-supervised learning despite the noise.\nWe use a standard NLP pipeline based on Stanford CoreNLP (for SQuAD, TrivaQA and PubMed) and the BANNER Named Entity Recognizer (only for PubMed articles) to identify entities and phrases. Assume that a document comprises of introduction sentences $\\lbrace q_1, q_2, ... q_n\\rbrace $ , and the remaining passages $\\lbrace p_1, p_2, .. p_m\\rbrace $ . Additionally, let's say that each sentence $q_i$ in introduction is composed of words $\\lbrace w_1, w_2, ... w_{l_{q_i}}\\rbrace $ , where $l_{q_i}$ is the length of $q_i$ . We consider a $\\text{match} (q_i, p_j)$ , if there is an exact string match of a sequence of words $\\lbrace w_k, w_{k+1}, .. w_{l_{q_i}}\\rbrace $ between the sentence $q_i$ and passage $p_j$ . If this sequence is either a noun phrase, verb phrase, adjective phrase or a named entity in $\\lbrace p_1, p_2, .. p_m\\rbrace $0 , as recognized by CoreNLP or BANNER, we select it as an answer span $\\lbrace p_1, p_2, .. p_m\\rbrace $1 . Additionally, we use $\\lbrace p_1, p_2, .. p_m\\rbrace $2 as the passage $\\lbrace p_1, p_2, .. p_m\\rbrace $3 and form a cloze question $\\lbrace p_1, p_2, .. p_m\\rbrace $4 from the answer bearing sentence $\\lbrace p_1, p_2, .. p_m\\rbrace $5 by replacing $\\lbrace p_1, p_2, .. p_m\\rbrace $6 with a placeholder. As a result, we obtain passage-question-answer ( $\\lbrace p_1, p_2, .. p_m\\rbrace $7 ) triples (Table 1 shows an example). As a post-processing step, we prune out $\\lbrace p_1, p_2, .. p_m\\rbrace $8 triples where the word overlap between the question (Q) and passage (P) is less than 2 words (after excluding the stop words).\nThe process relies on the fact that answer candidates from the introduction are likely to be discussed in detail in the remainder of the article. In effect, the cloze question from the introduction and the matching paragraph in the body forms a question and context passage pair. We create two cloze datasets, one each from Wikipedia corpus (for SQuAD and TriviaQA) and PUBMed academic papers (for the BioASQ challenge), consisting of 2.2M and 1M clozes respectively. From analyzing the cloze data manually, we were able to answer 76% times for the Wikipedia set and 80% times for the PUBMed set using the information in the passage. In most cases the cloze paraphrased the information in the passage, which we hypothesized to be a useful signal for the downstream QA task.\nWe also investigate the utility of forming subsets of the large cloze corpus, where we select the top passage-question-answer triples, based on the different criteria, like i) jaccard similarity of answer bearing sentence in introduction and the passage ii) the tf-idf scores of answer candidates and iii) the length of answer candidates. However, we empirically find that we were better off using the entire set rather than these subsets.\nPre-training: We make use of the generated cloze dataset to pre-train an expressive neural network designed for the task of reading comprehension. We work with two publicly available neural network models – the GA Reader BIBREF2 (to enable comparison with prior work) and BiDAF + Self-Attention (SA) model from BIBREF1 (which is among the best performing models on SQuAD and TriviaQA). After pretraining, the performance of BiDAF+SA on a dev set of the (Wikipedia) cloze questions is 0.58 F1 score and 0.55 Exact Match (EM) score. This implies that the cloze corpus is neither too easy, nor too difficult to answer.\nFine Tuning: We fine tune the pre-trained model, from the previous step, over a small set of labelled question-answer pairs. As we shall later see, this step is crucial, and it only requires a handful of labelled questions to achieve a significant proportion of the performance typically attained by training on tens of thousands of questions.\nDatasets\nWe apply our system to three datasets from different domains. SQuAD BIBREF3 consists of questions whose answers are free form spans of text from passages in Wikipedia articles. We follow the same setting as in BIBREF0 , and split $10\\%$ of training questions as the test set, and report performance when training on subsets of the remaining data ranging from $1\\%$ to $90\\%$ of the full set. We also report the performance on the dev set when trained on the full training set ( $1^\\ast $ in Table 2 ). We use the same hyperparameter settings as in prior work. We compare and study four different settings: 1) the Supervised Learning (SL) setting, which is only trained on the supervised data, 2) the best performing GDAN model from BIBREF0 , 3) pretraining on a Language Modeling (LM) objective and fine-tuning on the supervised data, and 4) pretraining on the Cloze dataset and fine-tuning on the supervised data. The LM and Cloze methods use exactly the same data for pretraining, but differ in the loss functions used. We report F1 and EM scores on our test set using the official evaluation scripts provided by the authors of the dataset.\nTriviaQA BIBREF4 comprises of over 95K web question-answer-evidence triples. Like SQuAD, the answers are spans of text. Similar to the setting in SQuAD, we create multiple smaller subsets of the entire set. For our semi-supervised QA system, we use the BiDAF+SA model BIBREF1 – the highest performing publicly available system for TrivaQA. Here again, we compare the supervised learning (SL) settings against the pretraining on Cloze set and fine tuning on the supervised set. We report F1 and EM scores on the dev set.\nWe also test on the BioASQ 5b dataset, which consists of question-answer pairs from PubMed abstracts. We use the publicly available system from BIBREF14 , and follow the exact same setup as theirs, focusing only on factoid and list questions. For this setting, there are only 899 questions for training. Since this is already a low-resource problem we only report results using 5-fold cross-validation on all the available data. We report Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) on the factoid questions, and F1 score for the list questions.\nMain Results\nTable 2 shows a comparison of the discussed settings on both SQuAD and TriviaQA. Without any fine-tuning (column 0) the performance is low, probably because the model never saw a real question, but we see significant gains with Cloze pretraining even with very little labeled data. The BiDAF+SA model, exceeds an F1 score of $50\\%$ with only $1\\%$ of the training data (454 questions for SQuAD, and 746 questions for TriviaQA), and approaches $90\\%$ of the best performance with only $10\\%$ labeled data. The gains over the SL setting, however, diminish as the size of the labeled set increases and are small when the full dataset is available.\nCloze pretraining outperforms the GDAN baseline from BIBREF0 using the same SQuAD dataset splits. Additionally, we show improvements in the $90\\%$ data case unlike GDAN. Our approach is also applicable in the extremely low-resource setting of $1\\%$ data, which we suspect GDAN might have trouble with since it uses the labeled data to do reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we are able to use the same cloze dataset to improve performance on both SQuAD and TriviaQA datasets. When we use the same unlabeled data to pre-train with a language modeling objective, the performance is worse, showing the bias we introduce by constructing clozes is important.\nOn the BioASQ dataset (Table 3 ) we again see a significant improvement when pretraining with the cloze questions over the supervised baseline. The improvement is smaller than what we observe with SQuAD and TriviaQA datasets – we believe this is because questions are generally more difficult in BioASQ. BIBREF14 showed that pretraining on SQuAD dataset improves the downstream performance on BioASQ. Here, we show a much larger improvement by pretraining on cloze questions constructed in an unsupervised manner from the same domain.\nAnalysis\nRegression Analysis: To understand which types of questions benefit from pre-training, we pre-specified certain features (see Figure 1 right) for each of the dev set questions in SQuAD, and then performed linear regression to predict the F1 score for that question from these features. We predict the F1 scores from the cloze pretrained model ( $y^{\\text{cloze}}$ ), the supervised model ( $y^{\\text{sl}}$ ), and the difference of the two ( $y^{\\text{cloze}}-y^{\\text{sl}}$ ), when using $10\\%$ of labeled data. The coefficients of the fitted model are shown in Figure 1 (left) along with their std errors. Positive coefficients indicate that a high value of that feature is predictive of a high F1 score, and a negative coefficient indicates that a small value of that feature is predictive of a high F1 score (or a high difference of F1 scores from the two models in the case of $y^{\\text{cloze}}-y^{\\text{sl}}$ ).\nThe two strongest effects we observe are that a high lexical overlap between the question and the sentence containing the answer is indicative of high boost with pretraining, and that a high lexical overlap between the question and the whole passage is indicative of the opposite. This is hardly surprising, since our cloze construction process is biased towards questions which have a similar phrasing to the answer sentences in context. Hence, test questions with a similar property are answered correctly after pretraining, whereas those with a high overlap with the whole passage tend to have lower performance. The pretraining also favors questions with short answers because the cloze construction process produces short answer spans. Also passages and questions which consist of tokens infrequent in the SQuAD training corpus receive a large boost after pretraining, since the unlabeled data covers a larger domain.\nPerformance on question types: Figure 2 shows the average gain in F1 score for different types of questions, when we pretrain on the clozes compared to the supervised case. This analysis is done on the $10\\%$ split of the SQuAD training set. We consider two classifications of each question – one determined on the first word (usually a wh-word) of the question (Figure 2 (bottom)) and one based on the output of a separate question type classifier adapted from BIBREF21 . We use the coarse grain labels namely Abbreviation (ABBR), Entity (ENTY), Description (DESC), Human (HUM), Location (LOC), Numeric (NUM) trained on a Logistic Regression classification system . While there is an improvement across the board, we find that abbreviation questions in particular receive a large boost. Also, \"why\" questions show the least improvement, which is in line with our expectation, since these usually require reasoning or world knowledge which cloze questions rarely require.\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we show that pre-training QA models with automatically constructed cloze questions improves the performance of the models significantly, especially when there are few labeled examples. The performance of the model trained only on the cloze questions is poor, validating the need for fine-tuning. Through regression analysis, we find that pretraining helps with questions which ask for factual information located in a specific part of the context. For future work, we plan to explore the active learning setup for this task – specifically, which passages and / or types of questions can we select to annotate, such that there is a maximum performance gain from fine-tuning. We also want to explore how to adapt cloze style pre-training to NLP tasks other than QA.\nAcknowledgments\nBhuwan Dhingra is supported by NSF under grants CCF-1414030 and IIS-1250956 and by grants from Google.

We hypothesize that the emergence and exact form of learning behaviors is naturally connected with the statistics of environmental fluctuations and tasks an organism needs to solve.\nHere, we study how different aspects of simulated environments shape an evolved synaptic plasticity rule in static and moving artificial agents. We demonstrate that environmental fluctuation and uncertainty control the reliance of artificial organisms on plasticity. Interestingly, the form of the emerging plasticity rule is additionally determined by the details of the task the artificial organisms are aiming to solve.\nMoreover, we show that coevolution between static connectivity and interacting plasticity mechanisms in distinct sub-networks changes the function and form of the emerging plasticity rules in embodied agents performing a foraging task. One of the defining features of living organisms is their ability to adapt to their environment and incorporate new information to modify their behavior.\nIt is unclear how the ability to learn first evolved , but its utility appears evident. Natural environments are too complex for all the necessary information to be hardcoded genetically and more importantly, they keep changing during an organism's lifetime in ways that cannot be anticipated ; . The link between learning and environmental uncertainty and fluctuation has been extensively demonstrated in both natural ; , and artificial environments .\nNevertheless, the ability to learn does not come without costs. For the capacity to learn to be beneficial in evolutionary terms, a costly nurturing period is often required, a phenomenon observed in both biological , and artificial organisms . Additionally, it has been shown that in some complex environments, hardcoded behaviors may be superior to learned ones given limits in the agent's lifetime and envi-ronmental uncertainty ; ; .\nThe theoretical investigation of the optimal balance between learned and innate behaviors in natural and artificial systems goes back several decades. However, it has recently found also a wide range of applications in applied AI systems ; . Most AI systems are trained for specific tasks, and have no need for modification after their training has been completed.\nStill, technological advances and the necessity to solve broad families of tasks make discussions about life-like AI systems relevant to a wide range of potential application areas. Thus the idea of open-ended AI agents that can continually interact with and adapt to changing environments has become particularly appealing.\nMany different approaches for introducing lifelong learning in artificial agents have been proposed. Some of them draw direct inspiration from actual biological systems ; . Among them, the most biologically plausible solution is to equip artificial neural networks with some local neural plasticity , similar to the large variety of synaptic plasticity mechanisms ; ; that performs the bulk of the learning in the brains of living organisms .\nThe artificial plasticity mechanisms can be optimized to modify the connectivity of the artificial neural networks toward solving a particular task. The optimization can use a variety of approaches, most commonly evolutionary computation. The idea of meta-learning or optimizing synaptic plasticity rules to perform specific functions has been recently established as an engineering tool that can compete with stateof-the-art machine learning algorithms on various complex tasks ; ; Pedersen and Risi (2021); .\nAdditionally, it can be used to reverse engineer actual plasticity mechanisms found in biological neural networks and uncover their functions ; . Here, we study the effect that different factors (environ-arXiv:2303.06734v1 [q-bio.NC] 12 Mar 2023 mental fluctuation and reliability, task complexity) have on the form of evolved functional reward-modulated plasticity rules.\nWe investigate the evolution of plasticity rules in static, single-layer simple networks. Then we increase the complexity by switching to moving agents performing a complex foraging task. In both cases, we study the impact of different environmental parameters on the form of the evolved plasticity mechanisms and the interaction of learned and static network connectivity.\nInterestingly, we find that different environmental conditions and different combinations of static and plastic connectivity have a very large impact on the resulting plasticity rules. We imagine an agent who must forage to survive in an environment presenting various types of complex food particles. Each food particle is composed of various amounts and combinations of N ingredients that can have positive (food) or negative (poison) values.\nThe value of a food particle is a weighted sum of its ingredients. To predict the reward value of a given resource, the agent must learn the values of these ingredients by interacting with the environment. The priors could be generated by genetic memory, but the exact values are subject to change. To introduce environmental variability, we stochastically change the values of the ingredients.\nMore precisely, we define two ingredient-value distributions E 1 and E 2 and switch between them, with probability p tr for every time step. We control how (dis)similar the environments are by parametrically setting E 2 = (1 − 2d e )E 1 , with d e ∈ [0, 1] serving as a distance proxy for the environments; when d e = 0, the environment remains unchanged, and when d e = 1 the value of each ingredient fully reverses when the environmental transition happens.\nFor simplicity, we take values of the ingredients in E 1 equally spaced between -1 and 1 (for the visualization, see Fig. ). The static agent receives passively presented food as a vector of ingredients and can assess its compound value using the linear summation of its sensors with the (learned or evolved) weights, see Fig. .\nThe network consists of N sensory neurons that are projecting to a single post-synaptic neuron. At each time step, an input X t = (x 1 , . . . , x N ) is presented, were the value x i , i ∈ {1, . . . , N } represents the quantity of the ingredient i. We draw x i independently form a uniform distribution on the [0, 1] interval (x i ∼ U (0, 1)).\nThe value of each ingredient w c i is determined by the environment (E 1 or E 2 ). The postsynaptic neuron outputs a prediction of the food X t value as y t = g(W X T t ). Throughout the paper, g will be either the identity function, in which case the prediction neuron is linear, or a step-function; however, it could be any other nonlinearity, such as a sigmoid or ReLU.\nAfter outputting the prediction, the neuron receives feedback in the form of the real value of the input R t . The real value is computed as R t = W c X T t + ξ, where W c = (w c 1 , . . . , w c N ) is the actual value of the ingredients, and ξ is a term summarizing the noise of reward and sensing system ξ ∼ N (0, σ).\nFigure : An outline of the static agent's network. The sensor layer receives inputs representing the quantity of each ingredient of a given food at each time step. The agent computes the prediction of the food's value y t and is then given the true value R t ; it finally uses this information in the plasticity rule to update the weight matrix.\nFor the evolutionary adjustment of the agent's parameters, the loss of the static agent is the sum of the mean squared errors (MSE) between its prediction y t and the reward R t over the lifetime of the agent. The agent's initial weights are set to the average of the two ingredient value distributions, which is the optimal initial value for the case of symmetric switching of environments that we consider here.\nAs a next step, we incorporate the sensory network of static agents into embodied agents that can move around in an environment scattered with food. To this end, we merge the static agent's network with a second, non-plastic motor network that is responsible for controlling the motion of the agent in the environment.\nSpecifically, the original plastic network now provides the agent with information about the value of the nearest food. The embodied agent has additional sensors for the distance from the nearest food, the angle between the current velocity and the nearest food direction, its own velocity, and its own energy level (sum of consumed food values).\nThese inputs are processed by two hidden layers (of 30 and 15 neurons) with tanh activation. The network's outputs are angular and linear acceleration, Fig. . The embodied agents spawn in a 2D space with periodic boundary conditions along with a number of food particles that are selected such that the mean of the food value distribution is ∼ 0. An agent can eat food by approaching it sufficiently closely, and each time a food particle is eaten, it is The sensor layer receives inputs at each time step (the ingredients of the nearest food), which are processed by the plastic layer in the same way as the static sensory network, Fig. .\nThe output of that network is given as input to the motor network, along with the distance d and angle α to the nearest food, the current velocity v, and energy E of the agent. These signals are processed through two hidden layers to the final output of motor commands as the linear and angular acceleration of the agent re-spawned with the same value somewhere randomly on the grid (following the setup of ).\nAfter 5000 time steps, the cumulative reward of the agent (the sum of the values of all the food it consumed) is taken as its fitness. During the evolutionary optimization, the parameters for both the motor network (connections) and plastic network (learning rule parameters) are co-evolved, and so agents must simultaneously learn to move and discriminate good/bad food.\nReward-modulated plasticity is one of the most promising explanations for biological credit assignment . In our network, the plasticity rule that updates the weights of the linear sensor network is a rewardmodulated rule which is parameterized as a linear combination of the input, the output, and the reward at each time step:\nAdditionally, after each plasticity step, the weights are normalized by mean subtraction, an important step for the stabilization of Hebbian-like plasticity rules . We use a genetic algorithm to optimize the learning rate η p and amplitudes of different terms θ = (θ 1 , . . . , θ 8 ). The successful plasticity rule after many food presentations must converge to a weight vector that predicts the correct food values (or allows the agent to correctly decide whether to eat a food or avoid it).\nTo have comparable results, we divide θ = (θ 1 , . . . , θ 8 ) by We then multiply the learning rate η p with θ max to maintain the rule's evolved form unchanged, η norm p = η p • θ max . In the following, we always use normalized η p and θ, omitting norm . To evolve the plasticity rule and the moving agents' motor networks, we use a simple genetic algorithm with elitism .\nThe agents' parameters are initialized at random (drawn from a Gaussian distribution), then the sensory network is trained by the plasticity rule and finally, the agents are evaluated. After each generation, the bestperforming agents (top 10 % of the population size) are selected and copied into the next generation.\nThe remaining 90 % of the generation is repopulated with mutated copies of the best-performing agents. We mutate agents by adding independent Gaussian noise (σ = 0.1) to its parameters. To start with, we consider a static agent whose goal is to identify the value of presented food correctly. The static reward-prediction network quickly evolves the parameters of the learning rule, successfully solving the prediction task.\nWe first look at the evolved learning rate η p , which determines how fast (if at all) the network's weight vector is updated during the lifetime of the agents. We identify three factors that control the learning rate parameter the EA converges to: the distance between the environments, the noisiness of the reward, and the rate of environmental transition.\nThe first natural factor is the distance d e between the two environments, with a larger distance requiring a higher learning rate, Fig. . This is an expected result since the convergence time to the \"correct\" weights is highly dependent on the initial conditions. If an agent is born at a point very close to optimality, which naturally happens if the environments are similar, the distance it needs to traverse on the fitness landscape is small.\nTherefore it can afford to have a small learning rate, which leads to a more stable convergence and is not affected by noise. A second parameter that impacts the learning rate is the variance of the rewards. The reward an agent receives for the plasticity step contains a noise term ξ that is drawn from a zero mean Gaussian distribution with standard deviation σ.\nThis parameter controls the unreliability of the agent's sensory system, i.e., higher σ means that the information the agent gets about the value of the foods it consumes cannot be fully trusted to reflect the actual value of the foods. As σ increases, the learning rate η p decreases, which means that the more unreliable an environment becomes, the less an agent relies on plasticity to update its weights, Fig. .\nIndeed for some combinations of relatively small distance d e and high reward variance σ, the EA converges to a learning rate of η p ≈ 0. This means that the agent opts to have no adaptation during its lifetime and remain at the mean of the two environments. It is an optimal solution when the expected loss due to ignoring the environmental transitions is, on average, lower than the loss the plastic network will incur by learning via the (often misleading because of the high σ) environmental cues.\nA final factor that affects the learning rate the EA will converge to is the frequency of environmental change during an agent's lifetime. Since the environmental change is modeled as a simple, two-state Markov process (Fig. ), the control parameter is the transition probability p tr . When keeping everything else the same, the learning rate rapidly rises as we increase the transition probability from 0, and after reaching a peak, it begins to decline slowly, eventually reaching zero (Fig. ).\nThis means that when environmental transition is very rare, agents opt for a very low learning rate, allowing a slow and stable convergence to an environment-appropriate weight vector that leads to very low losses while the agent remains in that environment. As the rate of environmental transition increases, faster learning is required to speed up convergence in order to exploit the (comparatively shorter) stays in each environment.\nFinally, as the environmental transition becomes too fast, the agents opt for slower or even no learning, which keeps them ) and the decision (b.) tasks, for a variety of parameters (p tr = 0.01, d e ∈ 0, 0.1, . . . , 1, and σ ∈ 0, 0.1, . . . , 1 in all 100 combinations). Despite the relatively small difference between the tasks, the evolved learning rules differ considerably.\nFor visual guidance, the lines connect θs from the same run. near the middle of the two environments, ensuring that the average loss of the two environments is minimal (Fig. ). The form of the evolved learning rule depends on the task: Decision vs. Prediction The plasticity parameters θ = (θ 1 , . . . , θ 8 ) for the rewardprediction task converge on approximately the same point, regardless of the environmental parameters (Fig. ).\nIn particular, θ 3 → 1, θ 5 → −1, θ i → 0 for all other i, and thus the learning rule converges to: Since by definition y t = g(W t X T t ) = W t X T t (g(x) = x in this experiment) and R t = W c X T t + ξ we get: Thus the distribution of ∆W t converges to a distribution with mean 0 and variance depending on η p and σ and W converges to W c .\nSo this learning rule will match the agent's weight vector with the vector of ingredient values in the environment. We examine the robustness of the learning rule the EA discovers by considering a slight modification of our task. Instead of predicting the expected food value, the agent now needs to decide whether to eat the presented food or not.\nThis is done by introducing a step-function nonlinearity (g(x) = 1 if x ≥ 1 and 0 otherwise). Then the output y(t) is computed as: Instead of the MSE loss between prediction and actual value, the fitness of the agent is now defined as the sum of the food values it chose to consume (by giving y t = 1). Besides these two changes, the setup of the experiments remains exactly the same.\nThe qualitative relation between η p and parameters of environment d e , σ and p tr is preserved in the changed experiment. However, the resulting learning rule is significantly different (Fig. ). The evolution converges to the following learning rule: In both cases, the rule has the form ∆W t = η p X t [α y R t + β y ].\nThus, the ∆W t is positive or negative depending on whether the reward R t is above or below a threshold (γ = −β y /α y ) that depends on the output decision of the network (y t = 0 or 1). Both learning rules (for the reward-prediction and decision tasks) have a clear Hebbian form (coordination of preand post-synaptic activity) and use the incoming reward signal as a threshold.\nThese similarities indicate some common organizing principles of reward-modulated learning rules, but their significant differences highlight the sensitivity of the optimization process to task details. We now turn to the moving embodied agents in the 2D environment. To optimize these agents, both the motor network's connections and the sensory network's plasticity parameters evolve simultaneously.\nSince the motor network is initially random and the agent has to move to find food, the number of interactions an agent experiences in its lifetime can be small, slowing down the learning. However, having the larger motor network also has benefits for evolution because it allows the output of the plastic network to be read out and transformed in different ways, resulting in a broad set of solutions.\nThe fitness of an agent (measured as the total food consumed over its lifetime) increases over generations of the EA for both the scalar and binary readouts in the sensory network. e. The Pearson correlation coefficient of an evolved agent's weights with the ingredient value vector of the current environment (E 1 -blue, E 2 -red).\nIn this example, the agent's weights are anti-correlated with its environment, which is not an issue for performance since the motor network can interpret the inverted signs of food. The agents can solve the task effectively by evolving a functional motor network and a plasticity rule that converges to interpretable weights (Fig. ).\nAfter ∼ 100 evolutionary steps (Fig. ), the agents can learn the ingredient value distribution using the plastic network and reliably move towards foods with positive values while avoiding the ones with negative values. We compare the dependence of the moving and the static agents on the parameters of the environment: d e and the state transition probability p tr .\nAt first, in order to simplify the experiment, we set the transition probability to 0, but fixed the initial weights to be the average of E 1 and E 2 , while the real state is E 2 . In this experiment, the distance between states d e indicates twice the distance between the agent's initial weights and the optimal weights (the environment's ingredient values) since the agent is initialized at the mean of the two environment distributions.\nSame as for the static agent, the learning rate increases with the distance d e (Fig. ). Then, we examine the effect of the environmental transition probability p tr on the evolved learning rate η p . In order for an agent to get sufficient exposure to each environment, we scale down the probability p tr from the equivalent experiment for the static agents.\nWe find that as the probability of transition increases, the evolved learning rate η p decreases (Fig. ). This fits with the larger trend for the static agent, although there is a clear difference when it comes to the increase for very small transition probabil-ities that were clearly identifiable in the static but not the moving agents.\nThis could be due to much sparser data and possibly the insufficiently long lifetime of the moving agent (the necessity of scaling makes direct comparisons difficult). Nevertheless, overall we see that the associations observed in the static agents between environmental distance d e and transition probability p tr and the evolved learning rate η p are largely maintained in the moving agents.\nStill, more data would be needed to make any conclusive assertions about the exact effect of these environmental parameters on the emerging plasticity mechanisms. A crucial difference between the static and the moving agents is the function the plasticity has to perform. While in the static agents, the plasticity has to effectively identify the exact value distribution of the environment in order to produce accurate predictions, in the embodied agents, the plasticity has to merely produce a representation of the environment that the motor network can evolve to interpret adequately enough to make decisions about which food to consume.\nTo illustrate the difference, we plot the Pearson correlation coefficient between an agent's weights and the ingredient values of the environment it is moving in (Fig. ). We use the correlation instead of the MSE loss (which we used for the static agents in Fig. ) because the amplitude of the vector varies a lot for different agents and meaningful The evolved parameters of moving agents' plasticity rule for the g(s) = x, identity (a.) and the step function (Eq.\n4) (b.) sensory networks (the environmental parameters here are d e ∈ [0, 1], σ = 0 and p tr = 0.001). The step function (binary output) network evolved a more structured plasticity rule (e.g., θ 3 > 0 for all realizations) than the linear network. Moreover, the learned weights for the identity network (c.) have higher variance and correlate significantly less with the environment's ingredient distribution compared to the learned weights for the thresholded network (d.)\nconclusions cannot be drawn from the MSE loss. For many agents, the learned weights are consistently anti-correlated with the actual ingredient values (an example of such an agent is shown in Fig. ). This means that the output of the sensory network will have the opposite sign from the actual food value.\nWhile in the static network, this would lead to very bad predictions and high loss, in the foraging task, these agents perform exactly as well as the ones where the weights and ingredients values are positively correlated, since the motor network can simply learn to move towards food for which it gets a negative instead of a positive sensory input.\nThis additional step of the output of the plastic network going through the motor network before producing any behavior has a strong effect on the plasticity rules that the embodied agents evolve. Specifically, if we look at the emerging rules the top performing agents have evolved (Fig. ), it becomes clear that, unlike the very well-structured rules of the static agents (Fig. ), there is now virtually no discernible pattern or structure.\nThe difference becomes even clearer if we look at the learned weights (at the end of a simulation) of the best-performing agents (Fig. ). While there is some correlation with the environment's ingredient value distribution, the variance is very large, and they do not seem to converge on the \"correct\" values in any way.\nThis is to some extent expected since, unlike the static agents where the network's output has to be exactly correct, driving the evolution of rules that converge to the precise environmental distribution, in the embodied networks, the bulk of the processing is done by the motor network which can evolve to interpret the scalar value of the sensory network's output in a variety of ways.\nThus, as long as the sensory network's plasticity rule co-evolves with the motor network, any plasticity rule that learns to produce consistent information about the value of encountered food can potentially be selected. To further test this assumption, we introduce a bottleneck of information propagation between the sensory and motor networks by using a step-function nonlinearity on the output of the sensory network (Eq.\n4). Similarly to the decision task of the static network, the output of the sensory network now becomes binary. This effectively reduces the flow of information from the sensory to the motor network, forcing the sensory network to consistently decide whether food should be consumed (with the caveat that the motor network can still interpret the binary sign in either of two ways, either consuming food marked with 1 or the ones marked with 0 by the sensory network).\nThe agents perform equally well in this variation of the task as before (Fig. ), but now, the evolved plasticity rules seem to be more structured (Fig. ). Moreover, the variance of the learned weights in the bestperforming agents is significantly reduced (Fig. ), which indicates that the bottleneck in the sensory network is in-creasing selection pressure for rules that learn the environment's food distribution accurately.\nWe find that different sources of variability have a strong impact on the extent to which evolving agents will develop neuronal plasticity mechanisms for adapting to their environment. A diverse environment, a reliable sensory system, and a rate of environmental change that is neither too large nor too small are necessary conditions for an agent to be able to effectively adapt via synaptic plasticity.\nAdditionally, we find that minor variations of the task an agent has to solve or the parametrization of the network can give rise to significantly different plasticity rules. Our results partially extend to embodied artificial agents performing a foraging task. We show that environmental variability also pushes the development of plasticity in such agents.\nStill, in contrast to the static agents, we find that the interaction of a static motor network with a plastic sensory network gives rise to a much greater variety of wellfunctioning learning rules. We propose a potential cause of this degeneracy; as the relatively complex motor network is allowed to read out and process the outputs from the plastic network, any consistent information coming out of these outputs can be potentially interpreted in a behaviorally useful way.\nReducing the information the motor network can extract from the sensory system significantly limits learning rule variability. Our findings on the effect of environmental variability concur with the findings of previous studies that have identified the constraints that environmental variability places on the evolutionary viability of learning behaviors.\nWe extend these findings in a mechanistic model which uses a biologically plausible learning mechanism (synaptic plasticity). We show how a simple evolutionary algorithm can optimize the different parameters of a simple reward-modulated plasticity rule for solving simple prediction and decision tasks.\nReward-modulated plasticity has been extensively studied as a plausible mechanism for credit assignment in the brain ; ; and has found several applications in artificial intelligence and robotics tasks ; . Here, we demonstrate how such rules can be very well-tuned to take into account different environmental parameters and produce optimal behavior in simple systems.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate how the co-evolution of plasticity and static functional connectivity in different subnetworks fundamentally changes the evolutionary pressures on the resulting plasticity rules, allowing for greater diversity in the form of the learning rule and the resulting learned connectivity.\nSeveral studies have demonstrated how, in biological networks, synaptic plasticity heavily interacts with and is driven by network topology . Moreover, it has been recently demonstrated that biological plasticity mechanisms are highly redundant in the sense that any observed neural connectivity or recorded activity can be achieved with a variety of distinct, unrelated learning rules .\nThis observed redundancy of learning rules in biological settings complements our results and suggests that the function of plasticity rules cannot be studied independently of the connectivity and topology of the networks they are acting on. The optimization of functional plasticity in neural networks is a promising research direction both as a means to understand biological learning processes and as a tool for building more autonomous artificial systems.\nOur results suggest that reward-modulated plasticity is highly adaptable to different environments and can be incorporated into larger systems that solve complex tasks. This work studies a simplified toy model of neural network learning in stochastic environments. Future work could be built on this basic framework to examine more complex reward distributions and sources of environmental variability.\nMoreover, a greater degree of biological realism could be added by studying more plausible network architectures (multiple plastic layers, recurrent and feedback connections) and more sophisticated plasticity rule parametrizations. Additionally, our foraging simulations were constrained by limited computational resources and were far from exhaustive.\nFurther experiments can investigate environments with different constraints, food distributions, multiple seasons, more complex motor control systems and interactions of those systems with different sensory networks as well as the inclusion of plasticity on the motor parts of the artificial organisms.", "full_doc_id": "doc-30c0af00613f3e3cbe33c34abcd8ef5e", "file_path": "unknown_source"}, {"__id__": "chunk-cc738a86294911bc35c624f7fc4493f0", "__created_at__": 1742541755.848854, "content": "Paper Info\n\nTitle: Generalized Pole-Residue Method for Dynamic Analysis of Nonlinear Systems based on Volterra Series\nPublish Date: March 7, 2023\nAuthor List: Qianying Cao (from State Key Laboratory of Coastal and Offshore Engineering, Dalian University of Technology), Anteng Chang (from College of Engineering, Ocean University of China), Junfeng Du (from College of Engineering, Ocean University of China), Lin Lu (from State Key Laboratory of Coastal and Offshore Engineering, Dalian University of Technology)\n\nFigure\n\nFig. 1: Procedure to compute the response by a combination of Volterra series and Laguerre polynomials\nFig. 2: Linear frequency response function: (a) Modulus of H 1 (ω), (b) phase angle of H 1 (ω)\nFig. 6: Comparison of h 1 (t) based on the analytical and reconstructed by Laguerre polynomials\nFig. 11: Response for Case 1: (a) comparison between the proposed method and Runge-Kutta method, (b) contribution of the three components\nFig. 18: Comparison of original excitations and reconstructed results: (a) Case 1, (b) Case 2 (c) Case 3\nFig. 19: Response to irregular excitation for Case 1: (a) comparison between the proposed method and Runge-Kutta method, (b) contribution of the three components\nFig. 23: Input-output dataset used to identify Volterra series: (a) input excitation, (b) output response\nFig. 26: Comparison of responses between the predicted and numerical results: (a) response to regular excitation, (b) response to irregular excitation\nParameter values of the irregular excitation\n\nabstract\n\nDynamic systems characterized by second-order nonlinear ordinary differential equations appear in many fields of physics and engineering. To solve these kinds of problems, time-consuming stepby-step numerical integration methods and convolution methods based on Volterra series in the time domain have been widely used.\nIn contrast, this work develops an efficient generalized pole-residue method based on the Volterra series performed in the Laplace domain. The proposed method involves two steps: (1) the Volterra kernels are decoupled in terms of Laguerre polynomials, and (2) the partial response related to a single Laguerre polynomial is obtained analytically in terms of the pole-residue method.\nCompared to the traditional pole-residue method for a linear system, one of the novelties of the pole-residue method in this paper is how to deal with the higher-order poles and their corresponding coefficients. Because the proposed method derives an explicit, continuous response function of time, it is much more efficient than traditional numerical methods.\nUnlike the traditional Laplace domain method, the proposed method is applicable to arbitrary irregular excitations. Because the natural response, forced response and cross response are naturally obtained in the solution procedure, meaningful mathematical and physical insights are gained. In numerical studies, systems with a known equation of motion and an unknown equation of motion are investigated.\nFor each system, regular excitations and complex irregular excitations with different parameters are studied. Numerical studies validate the good accuracy and high efficiency of the proposed method by comparing it with the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method.\n\nIntroduction\n\nMost real dynamic systems, as encountered in mechanical and civil engineering, are inherently nonlinear and include geometric nonlinearities, nonlinear constitutive relations in material or nonlinear resistances, etc. . Nonlinear problems are attracting increasing attention from engineers and scientists.\nThis work focuses on solving nonlinear system vibration problems, i.e., computing transient responses of nonlinear oscillators under arbitrary irregular excitations based on a combination of a pole-residue operation and Volterra series. Because Volterra series are single-valued, the scope of the present study is restricted to nonlinear behaviours without bifurcations .\nTo analyse nonlinear vibration problems, researchers have performed extensive studies and developed various mathematical methods. Popular methods include step-by-step numerical integration methods in the time domain, such as the Runge-Kutta method. This kind of method not only requires a small time-step resolution for obtaining high-precision solutions but also is prone to numerical instability .\nFor a long response with small time steps, the time domain methods are very costly in computational time. Volterra series is another widely used method, which is the extension of the Duhamel integral for linear systems . Volterra series can reproduce many nonlinear phenomena, but they are very complex due to higher-dimensional convolution integrals .\nSince 1980's, significant progress has been made in the general area of the Volterra series. The reader is referred to Ref. for a quite thorough literature review on the relevant topics. After 2017, most papers focus on Volterra series identification. De Paula and Marques proposed a method for the identification of Volterra kernels, which was based on time-delay neural networks.\nSon and Kim presented a method for a direct estimation of the Volterra kernel coefficients. Dalla Libera et al. introduced two new kernels for Volterra series identification. Peng et al. used the measured response to identify the kernel function and performed the nonlinear structural damage detection. Only a few papers concentrated on simplifying the computation of convolution integrals.\nTraditional methods for computing convolution integrals involved in the Volterra series have been performed in three distinct domains: time, frequency and Laplace. The time domain method based on Volterra series refers to discrete time convolution methods, which also suffer computational cost problems .\nBoth the frequency domain method and the Laplace domain method based on the Volterra series consist of three steps: (1) Volterra series are transformed into an algebraic equation in the frequency domain or Laplace domain; the algebraic equation is solved by purely algebraic manipulations; and (3) the solution in Step ( ) is transformed back to the time domain.\nMany researchers have used the frequency domain method to compute the responses of nonlinear systems. Billings et al. developed a new method for identifying the generalized frequency response function (GFRF) of nonlinear systems and then predicted the nonlinear response based on these GFRFs. Carassale et al. introduced a frequency domain approach for nonlinear bridge aerodynamics and aeroelasticity.\nHo et al. computed an output frequency domain function of a nonlinear damped duffing system modelled by a Volterra series under a sinusoidal input. Kim et al. identified the higher order frequency response functions by using the nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous input technique and the harmonic probing method.\nThis type of frequency domain method is much more efficient than the time domain method due to the fast Fourier transform algorithm. However, the frequency domain method not only is limited by frequency resolutions but also suffers from leakage problems due to the use of discrete Fourier transforms. In addition, the frequency domain method calculates only a steady-state response.\nA natural response generated by initial conditions and a cross response caused by interactions between a system and an excitation are ignored. In contrast, the Laplace domain method can calculate all response components because initial conditions are considered in the computational procedure. However, it has been restricted to analytical operations for simple excitations, such as sinusoidal excitations and exponential excitations .\nThe proposed method falls into the category of the Volterra series method computed in the Laplace domain. Unlike the traditional Laplace domain method, the proposed method is applicable to arbitrary irregular excitations. Because the proposed method follows a similar path as a pole-residue method for linear systems , the proposed method to solve nonlinear system vibration problems is called the generalized pole-residue method.\nThe main concept of the pole-residue method developed by Hu et al. was that the poles and residues of the response could be easily obtained from those of the input and system transfer function to obtain the closed-form response solution of linear systems. This method included three steps: (1) writing the system transfer function into pole-residue form; (2) writing the excitation into pole-residue form by the Prony-SS method; (3) computing the poles and residues of the response by an algebraic operation based on those from system and excitation.\nCompared to Hu et al. , which was regarded as an efficient tool to compute responses of linear systems, the generalized pole-residue method in this paper is introduced to compute responses of nonlinear systems. The proposed method involves two steps: (1) the Volterra kernels are decoupled in terms of Laguerre polynomials, and (2) the partial response related to a single Laguerre polynomial is obtained analytically in terms of the pole-residue method.\nCompared to the traditional pole-residue method for a linear system, one of the novelties of the generalized pole-residue method is how to deal with the higher-order poles and their corresponding coefficients. Similar to the Taylor series, the Volterra series representation is an infinite series, and convergence conditions are needed to assure that the representation is meaningful.\nBecause the proposed method is based on the Volterra series, only the system with convergent Volterra series representation can be treated by the proposed method. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the nonlinear response is modelled by a Volterra series, and Volterra kernel functions are decoupled by Laguerre polynomials.\nThen, the pole-residue method for computing explicit responses is developed in Section 3. Numerical studies and discussions are given in Section 4. Finally, the conclusions are drawn in Section 5.\n\nResponse calculation based on Volterra series\n\nA nonlinear oscillator, whose governing equation of motion is given by where z(t, y, ẏ) represents an arbitrary nonlinear term; m, c, and k are the mass, damping and linear stiffness, respectively; y(t), ẏ(t) and ÿ(t) are the displacement, velocity and acceleration, respectively; and f (t) is the time-dependent excitation.\nIf the energy of excitation f (t) is limited, the nonlinear response under zero initial conditions (i.e., zero displacement and zero velocity) can be represented by the Volterra series : where N is the order of Volterra series and In Eq. 3, h 1 (τ ) is called the first-order Volterra kernel function, which represents the linear behaviour of the system; h n (τ 1 , . . .\n, τ n ) for n > 1 are the higher-order Volterra kernel functions, which describe the nonlinear behaviour of the system. The complete formulation of y(t) includes infinite series where the labour of calculating the n th term increases quickly with the growth of n. Fortunately, the response accuracy may be ensured by the first several order Volterra series.\nThis is proved here in numerical studies. The commonly known Laguerre polynomials are represented as : where p i is the order of the Laguerre polynomials and a i is the damping rate. The Laguerre polynomials satisfy the orthogonal relationship expressed as: By using Laguerre polynomials, the Volterra kernel function h n (t 1 , . . .\n, t n ) in Eq. 3 can be decoupled as follows : where the coefficient is computed resorting to the orthogonal relationship in Eq. 5: Substituting Eq. 6 into Eq. 3 yields . . . The above operation that uses the Laguerre polynomials to decouple Volterra higher order kernel functions has been well-developed.\nThe reader is referred to Refs. for details about the adopted technique. After decoupling Volterra higher order kernel functions in time, one can regroup Eq. 8 into: . . . By denoting Eq. 9 becomes The above procedure to compute the nonlinear response by a combination of Volterra series and Laguerre polynomials is schematically shown in Fig. .\nVolterra kernel functions h n (t 1 , . . . , t n ) can be obtained by either an equation of motion or measured input-output signals. To derive a closedform solution of the response, we must obtain a closed-form solution of x i (t) first. In the following presentation, a closed-form solution of the aforementioned x i (t) and y n (t) is derived by using the pole-residue method.\n3. Pole-residue method for calculating x i (t) and y n (t) Performing the Laplace transform of x i (t) in Eq. 10 yields where in which Eq. 13 includes a single pole and several higher-order poles. For k = 0, −a i is a single pole, and b p i (0) is a corresponding coefficient, namely, the residue. For k > 0, −a i are higher-order poles, and b p i (k) are corresponding coefficients.\nFor an irregular excitation signal f (t) of a finite duration of T , it can always be approximated into a pole-residue form by using the complex exponential signal decomposition method-Prony-SS : where N ℓ is the number of components; α ℓ and λ ℓ are constant coefficients, which either are real numbers or occur in complex conjugate pairs.\nWe define λ ℓ = −δ ℓ + iΩ ℓ , where Ω ℓ is the excitation frequency and δ ℓ is the damping factor of the ℓ th component. We denote α ℓ = A ℓ e iθ ℓ , where A ℓ is the amplitude and θ ℓ is the sinusoidal initial phase in radians. Taking the Laplace transform of Eq. 15 yields Note that the concept of the Prony-SS method is similar to that of a principal component method.\nA smooth excitation usually requires just several terms to achieve a good approximation. For high irregular loadings, including more terms would achieve a better approximation. Substituting Eqs. 13 and 16 into Eq. 12 yields Expressing xi (s) in its pole-residue form yields where λ ℓ are simple poles, and the corresponding residues are easily obtained by\nand −a i are higher-order poles, and the corresponding coefficients are firstly derived as: By taking the inverse Laplace transform of Eq. 18, a closed-form solution is obtained: Substituting Eqs. 11 and 21 into Eq. 2 yields Theoretically speaking, the proposed method for deriving the closed-form solution of the nonlinear response is applicable to any order of the Volterra series.\nFor practical engineering, usually only the first several order responses dominate. By setting up N = 2, Eq. 22 can be simplified into three components: where the natural response, which is only related to system poles, is given by and the cross response, which is related to both system poles and excitation poles, is given by\nand the forced response, which is related only to excitation poles, is given by The first term in Eq. 26 is the first-order forced response governed by the excitation frequency, i.e., the imaginary part of the pole λ ℓ . The second term corresponds to the second-order nonlinear forced response, which includes the sum frequency and difference frequency responses governed by λ ℓ + λ j .\nEq. 26 straightforwardly offers visible information about the possible nonlinear vibrations by the cooperation of excitation frequencies. Particularly, consider a sinusoidal excitation f (t) = sin ω r t, which can be expressed as f (t) = γe λt + γ * e λ * t , where γ = −0.5i and λ = iω r . Substituting these values into Eq.\n26, the second term of Eq. 26 is simplified as where the first term is the difference frequency response, and the second term is the sum frequency response.\n\nNumerical studies\n\nIn practical engineering, some systems have an accurate equation of motion. Additionally, some systems have difficulty constructing their equations of motion because of complex nonlinear dynamic behaviours and uncertain system parameters. In this article, a system with a known equation of motion is called a known system, and a system with an unknown equation of motion is called an unknown system for simplicity.\nIn this section, two numerical studies are presented. The first study verifies the proposed method using a known nonlinear oscillator, and the second study demonstrates the applicability of the proposed method to an unknown system. Throughout the numerical studies, the unit system is the metre-kilogramme-second (MKS) system; for conciseness, explicit units for quantities are omitted.\n\nA known nonlinear system\n\nThis study chooses a nonlinear oscillator written as: where mass m = 1, damping c = 1, linear stiffness k 1 = 10, quadratic stiffness k 2 = 20 and cubic stiffness k 3 = 20. It is a case that has been studied in a previously published article . The linear natural frequency of the system ω 0 = k 1 /m = 3.16 and the damping ratio ζ = c/(2mω 0 ) = 15.8%.\nThis kind of oscillator occurs in many engineering problems, such as a model of fluid resonance in a narrow gap between large vessels . In the model, k 1 y represents the linear restoring force of the fluid, and k 2 y 2 and k 3 y 3 are respectively the quadratic and cubic nonlinear restoring forces of the fluid.\n\nVolterra kernel functions\n\nGenerally, the first several order responses dominate the total response of a system. Hence, the order of the Volterra series in Eq. 22 is chosen to be 3, namely, N = 3. For computing the first three order responses from Eq. 22, the first three order Volterra kernel functions need to be known. Since Volterra kernel functions and corresponding frequency response functions are related by a specific Fourier transform pair, we can first write the first three orders of frequency response functions directly from Eq. 28.\nThen, Volterra kernel functions are obtained by the inverse Fourier transform. Based on the harmonic probing algorithm , the linear frequency response function (LFRF) H 1 (ω), the quadratic frequency response function (QFRF) H 2 (ω 1 , ω 2 ) and the cubic frequency response function (CFRF) H 3 (ω 1 , ω 2 , ω 3 ) are analytically given by:\nand Figures show H 1 (ω), H 2 (ω 1 , ω 2 ) and H 3 (ω 1 , ω 2 , ω 3 ), respectively, which agree well with those reported in Ref. . As expected, the modulus of H 1 (ω) in Fig. peaks near the linear natural frequency ω 0 , and the phase angle decreases monotonically from 0 to -π with increasing frequency.\nFigure shows the sum frequency QFRF, where the energy converges along the line of ω 1 +ω 2 ≈ ω 0 . Therefore, when the sum frequency of a two-tone excitation equals the linear resonant frequency, the second-order response may reach its maximum. Additionally, those pairs of excitations in line ω 1 + ω 2 ≈ ω 0 may produce non-negligible vibration magnitudes due to second-order nonlinear effects.\nFor the difference frequency QFRF in Fig. (b), the energy converges along two main lines, i.e., ω 1 ≈ ω 0 and ω 2 ≈ ω 0 . Figures show moduli of H 3 (ω, ω, ω) and H 3 (ω, ω, −ω), which are diagonal terms of the sum frequency CFRF and the difference frequency CFRF, respectively. While the modulus of H 3 (ω, ω, ω) peaks near ω ≈ ω 0 /3 and ω 0 , that of H 3 (ω, ω, −ω) peaks near ω ≈ ω 0 with a small hump around ω ≈ ω 0 /2.\nValues at ω ≈ ω 0 /3 and ω 0 /2 may be magnified by higher-order stiffness terms in Eq. 28. By performing the inverse fast Fourier transform to Eqs. 29-31, the corresponding linear impulse response function h 1 (t), quadratic impulse response function h 2 (t 1 , t 2 ) and cubic impulse response function h 3 (t 1 , t 2 , t 3 ) are obtained.\nHere, h 1 (t) and h 2 (t 1 , t 2 ) are plotted in Figs. , respectively, and h 3 (t, t, t) is shown in Fig. . In the numerical implementation, Eqs. 29-31 have been utilized with the frequency interval ∆ω = 0.1, number of frequency components N n = 1025, and cut-off frequencies 102.4 and −102.4. For decoupling Volterra kernel functions by using Laguerre polynomials, the damping rate and number of Laguerre polynomials for each order Volterra kernel function need to be determined (see Eqs. 4 and 6).\nIn this example, we set a 1 = a 2 = a 3 = 2 and R 1 = R 2 = R 3 = 24 because coefficients c p 1 ...pn become very small when R n > 24, n = 1, 2, 3. According to Eq. 7, the coefficients of the first three order Volterra kernel functions are calculated, which are shown in Figs. 9 and 10. For convenience, Fig. plots only c p 1 p 2 p 3 for p 3 = 0.\nWith the increase of the order of Laguerre polynomials, coefficients in Figs. 9 and 10 gradually decrease, which illustrates how the first several orders of Laguerre polynomials dominate all orders of the Volterra kernel function. With the known Laguerre polynomials and corresponding coefficients, Volterra kernel functions are reconstructed by Eq. 6.\nFor comparison, reconstructed Volterra kernel functions are also plotted in Figs. . The reconstructed results agree well with the analytical values, which verifies the accuracy of the decomposition.\n\nSinusoidal excitation\n\nFrom Eq. 28, we consider a sinusoidal excitation where A and Ω are the amplitude and the frequency, respectively. Five cases of A and Ω are shown in Table . Excitation frequencies in Cases 1 and 2 are larger than the linear natural frequency (ω 0 ≈ 3.16), those in Case 3 are very close to ω 0 , and those in Cases 4 and 5 are smaller than ω 0 .\nAll cases have same amplitudes. The poles of a sinusoidal excitation are λ 1,2 = ±iΩ, and the residues are α 1,2 = ∓iA/2. Numerical values of excitation poles and residues for different cases are listed in Table . Table : Parameter values, poles and residues of the sinusoidal excitation Substituting poles and residues of the excitation, as well as those of the system into Eqs.\n20 and 19, response coefficients β p i ,k corresponding to system poles −a i and response coefficients γ p i ,ℓ corresponding to excitation poles λ ℓ are calculated, respectively. According to Eq. 22, the first three orders of responses for each case in Table are calculated. Figures )-15(a) show the comparison of responses obtained by the proposed method and the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with ∆t = 10 −4 .\nFor Cases 1 and 2, the first-order responses agree well with the total responses obtained by the Runge-Kutta method, and the higher-order responses only slightly improve the transient parts. For Cases 3-5, the sum of the first three orders of responses is in good agreement with the Runge-Kutta solution.\nWhen the response nonlinearity increases, higher-order responses need to be considered. In other words, the proposed method can accurately compute the nonlinear responses by choosing a small number N of Volterra series terms. Figures )-15(b) show the contributions of the three response components for the five cases.\nIn each case, the first-order response is the most dominant component, and the contributions of secondand third-order responses are much less than those of the first-order response. Especially for Cases 1 and 2, whose excitation frequencies are far from the linear natural frequency, second-and thirdorder responses are close to zero.\nThis may be because the QFRF and CFRF approach zero when the frequency is larger than 4 rad/s (see Figs. ). Furthermore, the mean values of the first-order responses are approximately zero, and those of the second-order responses are always smaller than zero, which are the difference frequency components in Eq. 27.\nMoreover, it is clearly observed that second-order responses for Cases 3-5 exhibit a periodic oscillation with a period near half of that for the first-order response, which is excited by the sum frequency component of the excitation (see second part of Eq. 27). Compared with steady-state solutions of first-and second-order responses, those of third-order responses in Cases 3-5 are no longer single regular motions.\nBy performing the FFT, frequency spectra of these three third-order responses are shown in Fig. . We find that these three third-order responses are all dominated by their own fundamental harmonic component and the third harmonic (triple frequency) component. Figure shows the computational time to calculate the response of the oscillator for Case 1 by the proposed method, the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method and the convolution method.\nThe proposed method, which has an explicit solution, is much more efficient in computational time than the latter two methods, which need small time steps to obtain high-precision solutions. In particular, the efficiency of the proposed method increases with the length of the response time. Computation time (sec.)\nt=0.02s Convolution, t=0.02s Convolution, t=0.001s Runge-Kutta, t=0.001s Fig. : Comparison of computation efficiency of the proposed method, the fourth-fifth order Runge-Kutta method and the convolution method regular loading in Case 1\n\nIrregular excitation\n\nIn Eq. 28, considering an irregular excitation consisting of several cosine functions where N f is the number of cosine components; A n , Ω n and θ n are the amplitude, frequency and phase angle of the n th component, respectively. Table lists three cases of these parameters. In each case, the amplitudes of all components are the same, and phase angles θ n uniformly distributed between 0 and 2π are randomly generated.\nTo decompose the excitation into a pole-residue form, the Prony-SS method is used, whose concept is similar to that of a principal component method. The readers are referred to Ref. for details. The chosen rank of each case is also shown in Table . Figure shows the comparison of original excitations and reconstructed results of these three cases, which all have excellent agreement.\nshow the results computed by the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. In all cases, the sums of the first three orders of responses agree well with those obtained by the Runge-Kutta method. The contributions of the first three orders of responses for each case are plotted in Figs. )-21(b). Similarly, the system vibration is dominated by the first-order response.\nHowever, the contributions of second-and third-order significantly grow with increasing excitation magnitude and frequency number. Furthermore, when the magnitude of the nonlinear response becomes large, sharp troughs are present. This phenomenon may be induced by the nonlinear stiffness. While the first-order response fails to capture these troughs, the higher-order responses successfully capture these troughs.\nFigure plots the computational time to calculate the response of the oscillator for the irregular loading in Case 1 by the proposed method and the fourth-fifth order Runge-Kutta method, respectively. While the fourth-fifth order Runge-Kutta method is more efficient under a small response length, the proposed method becomes much more efficient when the response length is larger than about 130 s.\nIn addition, the proposed method obtains the explicit response solution, so one can directly obtain the response value at a specific time t p instead of integrating from 0 to t p for traditional numerical methods. Computation time (sec.) Proposed, t=0.02s Runge-Kutta, t=0.001s Fig. : Comparison of computation efficiency of the method and the fourth-fifth order Runge-Kutta method for irregular loading in Case 1\n\nAn unknown nonlinear\n\nTo check the applicability of the proposed method to an unknown nonlinear system, a known input excitation and its corresponding response are used to identify its Volterra kernel functions. When the Volterra kernel functions are known, we can follow the procedure in Section 4.1 to predict system responses.\nIn this study, the input excitation is white noise with a constant power spectrum S 0 = 0.001, and the corresponding response is obtained by solving Eq. 28 by the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, which is shown in Fig. . From Section 4.1, we determine that the sum of the first two orders of responses agrees well with the total response.\nIn this study, the order of Volterra series N is chosen to be 2, damping rates of Laguerre polynomials are a 1 = a 2 = 2, and numbers of Laguerre polynomials are R 1 = R 2 = 24. To estimate the first two orders of Volterra kernel functions, a matrix equation is constructed using excitation data and response data.\nBy using the least square method to solve this matrix equation, coefficients c p 1 and c p 1 p 2 in Eq. 8 are identified. Figure plots c p 1 and c p 1 p 2 , respectively, which have good agreement with the exact results in Fig. . Then, the first two order Volterra kernel functions are constructed by Eq. 6.\nCompared with the exact results in Figs. , the identified Volterra kernel functions in Fig. completely agree well with the exact solutions. Note that the white noise excitation, which can excite more frequency components of the response, is chosen to obtain good Volterra kernel functions. A regular excitation f (t) = sin(πt) and an irregular excitation f (t) = N f n=1 A n cos(Ω n t + θ n ) with A n = 0.3 and Ω n varying from 0 to 40 with equal interval 1 are chosen as input excitations.\nThe predicted responses, along with results obtained by the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, are shown in Fig. . In both cases, the proposed method accurately predicts system responses. As presented in Eq. 23, a nonlinear response is the sum of three terms: natural response y s (t), forced response y f (t) and cross response y c (t).\nThese individual terms, as well as their sum to two excitations, are shown in Figs. 27 and 28, respectively. As shown in Figs. and 28, both first-and second-order responses include the natural response y s (t) and the forced response y f (t), but the cross response y c (t) only exists in second-order responses.\nWhen t becomes larger, both y s (t) and y c (t) diminish due to the presence of system damping, and the total response is entirely governed by y f (t). Moreover, we notice some features at t = 0 for these components, including y s (0) = −y f (0) for the first-order response and y s (0) + y f (0) = −y c (0) for the second-order response, which are due to imposed zero initial conditions.\n\nConclusions\n\nConsidering arbitrary irregular excitations, an efficient generalized pole-residue method to compute the nonlinear dynamic response modelled by the Volterra series was developed. A core of the proposed method was obtaining poles and corresponding coefficients of Volterra kernel functions, then those of each order response modelled by each order Volterra series.\nOnce the poles and corresponding coefficients of Volterra kernel functions and excitations were both available, the remaining derivation could follow a similar pole-residue method that had been developed for ordinary linear oscillators. To obtain the poles and corresponding coefficients of Volterra kernel functions, two steps were included: (1) using Laguerre polynomials to decouple higher-order Volterra kernel functions with respect to time and (2) obtaining poles and corresponding coefficients of Laguerre polynomials in the Laplace domain.\nBecause the proposed method gave an explicit, continuous response function of time, it was much more efficient than traditional numerical methods. Moreover, many meaningful physical and mathematical insights were gained because not only each order response but also the natural response, the forced response and the cross response of each order were obtained in the solution procedure.\nTo demonstrate that the proposed method was not only suitable for a system with a known equation of motion but also applicable to a system with an unknown equation of motion, two numerical studies were conducted. For each study, regular excitations and complex irregular excitations with different parameters were investigated.\nThe efficiency of the proposed method was verified by the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. This paper only computes the response under zero initial conditions. The response under non-zero initial conditions will be investigated in our future work.", "full_doc_id": "doc-cc738a86294911bc35c624f7fc4493f0", "file_path": "unknown_source"}, {"__id__":

Here, we report the generation of unsubstituted indeno[1,2-a]fluorene, the final and yet unreported parent indenofluorene regioisomer, on various surfaces by cleavage of two C-H bonds in 7,12-dihydro indeno[1,2-a]fluorene through voltage pulses applied by the tip of a combined scanning tunneling microscope and atomic force microscope.\nOn bilayer NaCl on Au(111), indeno[1,2a]fluorene is in the neutral charge state, while it exhibits charge bistability between neutral and anionic states on the lower work function surfaces of bilayer NaCl on Ag(111) and Cu(111). In the neutral state, indeno[1,2-a]fluorene exhibits either of two ground states: an open-shell π-diradical state, predicted to be a triplet by density functional and multireference many-body perturbation theory calculations, or a closedshell state with a para-quinodimethane moiety in the as-indacene core.\nSwitching between open-and closed-shell states of a single molecule is observed by changing its adsorption site on NaCl. The inclusion of non-benzenoid carbocyclic rings is a viable route to tune the physicochemical properties of polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbons (PCHs) . Non-benzenoid polycycles may lead to local changes in strain, conjugation, aromaticity, and, relevant to the context of the present work, induce an open-shell ground state of the corresponding PCHs .\nMany nonbenzenoid PCHs are also non-alternant, where the presence of odd-membered polycycles breaks the bipartite symmetry of the molecular network . Figure shows classical examples of non-benzenoid non-alternant PCHs, namely, pentalene, azulene and heptalene. Whereas azulene is a stable PCH exhibiting Hückel aromaticity ([4n+2] π-electrons, n = 2), pentalene and heptalene are unstable Hückel antiaromatic compounds with [4n] π-electrons, n = 2 (pentalene) and n = 3 (heptalene).\nBenzinterposition of pentalene generates indacenes, consisting of two isomers s-indacene and as-indacene (Fig. ). Apart from being antiaromatic, indacenes also contain proaromatic quinodimethane (QDM) moieties (Fig. ) , which endows them with potential open-shell character. While the parent s-indacene and asindacene have never been isolated, stable derivatives of s-indacene bearing bulky substituents have been synthesized .\nA feasible strategy to isolate congeners of otherwise unstable non-benzenoid non-alternant PCHs is through fusion of benzenoid rings at the ends of the π-system, that is, benzannelation. For example, while the parent pentalene is unstable, the benzannelated congener indeno[2,1-a]indene is stable under ambient conditions (Fig. ) .\nHowever, the position of benzannelation is crucial for stability: although indeno[2,1a]indene is stable, its regioisomer indeno[1,2-a]indene (Fig. ) oxidizes under ambient conditions . Similarly, benzannelation of indacenes gives rise to the family of PCHs known as indenofluorenes (Fig. ), which constitute the topic of the present work.\nDepending on the benzannelation position and the indacene core, five regioisomers can be constructed, namely, indeno [ Practical interest in indenofluorenes stems from their low frontier orbital gap and excellent electrochemical characteristics that render them as useful components in organic electronic devices .\nThe potential open-shell character of indenofluorenes has led to several theoretical studies on their use as non-linear optical materials and as candidates for singlet fission in organic photovoltaics . Recent theoretical work has also shown that indenofluorene-based ladder polymers may exhibit fractionalized excitations.\nFundamentally, indenofluorenes represent model systems to study the interplay between aromaticity and magnetism at the molecular scale . Motivated by many of these prospects, the last decade has witnessed intensive synthetic efforts toward the realization of indenofluorenes. Derivatives of 1-4 have been realized in solution , while 1-3 have also been synthesized on surfaces and characterized using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), which provide information on molecular orbital densities , molecular structure and oxidation state .\nWith regards to the open-shell character of indenofluorenes, 2-4 are theoretically and experimentally interpreted to be closed-shell, while calculations indicate that 1 and 5 should exhibit open-shell ground states . Bulk characterization of mesitylsubstituted 1, including X-ray crystallography, temperature-dependent NMR, and electron spin resonance spectroscopy, provided indications of its open-shell ground state .\nElectronic characterization of 1 on Au(111) surface using scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) revealed a low electronic gap of 0.4 eV (ref. ). However, no experimental proof of an openshell ground state of 1 on Au(111), such as detection of singly occupied molecular orbitals (SOMOs) or spin excitations and correlations due to unpaired electrons , was shown.\nIn this work, we report the generation and characterization of unsubstituted 5. Our research is motivated by theoretical calculations that indicate 5 to exhibit the largest diradical character among all indenofluorene isomers . The same calculations also predict that 5 should possess a triplet ground state.\nTherefore, 5 would qualify as a Kekulé triplet, of which only a handful of examples exist . However, definitive synthesis of 5 has never been reported so far. Previously, Dressler et al. reported transient isolation of mesityl-substituted 5, where it decomposed both in the solution and in solid state , and only the structural proof of the corresponding dianion was obtained.\nOn-surface generation of a derivative of 5, starting from truxene as a precursor, was recently reported . STM data on this compound, containing the indeno[1,2-a]fluorene moiety as part of a larger PCH, was interpreted to indicate its open-shell ground state. However, the results did not imply the ground state of unsubstituted 5. Here, we show that on insulating surfaces 5 can exhibit either of two ground states: an open-shell or a closed-shell.\nWe infer the existence of these two ground states based on high-resolution AFM imaging with bond-order discrimination and STM imaging of molecular orbital densities . AFM imaging reveals molecules with two different geometries. Characteristic bond-order differences in the two geometries concur with the geometry of either an open-or a closed-shell state.\nConcurrently, STM images at ionic resonances show molecular orbital densities corresponding to SOMOs for the open-shell geometry, but orbital densities of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) for the closed-shell geometry. Our experimental results are in good agreement with density functional theory (DFT) and multireference perturbation theory calculations.\nFinally, we observe switching between open-and closed-shell states of a single molecule by changing its adsorption site on the surface. Synthetic strategy toward indeno[1,2-a]fluorene. The generation of 5 relies on the solution-phase synthesis of the precursor 7,12-dihydro indeno[1,2-a]fluorene (6). Details on synthesis and characterization of 6 are reported in Supplementary Figs.\n. Single molecules of 6 are deposited on coinage metal (Au(111), Ag(111) and Cu(111)) or insulator surfaces. In our work, insulating surfaces correspond to two monolayer-thick (denoted as bilayer) NaCl on coinage metal surfaces. Voltage pulses ranging between 4-6 V are applied by the tip of a combined STM/AFM system, which result in cleavage of one C-H bond at each of the pentagonal apices of 6, thereby leading to the generation of 5 (Fig. ).\nIn the main text, we focus on the generation and characterization of 5 on insulating surfaces. Generation and characterization of 5 on coinage metal surfaces is shown in Supplementary Fig. . ).

The bright and dark features in the trilayer NaCl island in g correspond to Cl -and Na + ions, respectively.\nScale bars: 10 Å (f) and 5 Å (g). To experimentally explore the electronic structure of 5, we used bilayer NaCl films on coinage metal surfaces to electronically decouple the molecule from the metal surfaces. Before presenting the experimental findings, we summarize the results of our theoretical calculations performed on 5 in the neutral charge state (denoted as 5 0 ).\nWe start by performing DFT calculations on 5 0 in the gas phase. Geometry optimization performed at the spin-unrestricted UB3LYP/6-31G level of theory leads to one local minimum, 5OS, the geometry of which corresponds to the open-shell resonance structure of 5 (Fig. , the label OS denotes open-shell).\nThe triplet electronic configuration of 5OS is the lowest-energy state, with the openshell singlet configuration 90 meV higher in energy. Geometry optimization performed at the restricted closed-shell RB3LYP/6-31G level reveals two local minima, 5para and 5ortho, the geometries of which (Fig. ) exhibit bond length alternations in line with the presence of a para-or an ortho-QDM moiety, respectively, in the as-indacene core of the closed-shell resonance structures of 5 (Fig. ) .\nRelative to 5OS in the triplet configuration, 5para and 5ortho are 0.40 and 0.43 eV higher in energy, respectively. Additional DFT results are shown in Supplementary Fig. . To gain more accurate insights into the theoretical electronic structure of 5, we performed multireference perturbation theory calculations (Supplementary Fig. ) based on quasi-degenerate second-order n-electron valence state perturbation theory (QD-NEVPT2).\nIn so far as the order of the ground and excited states are concerned, the results of QD-NEVPT2 calculations qualitatively match with DFT calculations. For 5OS, the triplet configuration remains the lowest-energy state, with the open-shell singlet configuration 60 meV higher in energy. The energy differences between the open-and closed-shell states are substantially reduced in QD-NEVPT2 calculations, with 5para and 5ortho only 0.11 and 0.21 eV higher in energy, respectively, compared to 5OS in the triplet configuration.\nWe also performed nucleus-independent chemical shift calculations to probe local aromaticity of 5 in the openand closed-shell states. While 5OS in the triplet configuration exhibits local aromaticity at the terminal benzenoid rings, 5OS in the open-shell singlet configuration, 5para and 5ortho all display antiaromaticity (Supplementary Fig. ).\nThe choice of the insulating surface determines the charge state of 5: while 5 adopts neutral charge state on the high work function bilayer NaCl/Au(111) surface (irrespective of its openor closed-shell state, Supplementary Fig. ), 5 exhibits charge bistability between 5 0 and the anionic state 5 -1 on the lower work function bilayer NaCl/Ag(111) and Cu(111) surfaces (Supplementary Figs. ).\nIn the main text, we focus on the characterization of 5 on bilayer NaCl/Au(111). Characterization of charge bistable 5 is reported in Supplementary Figs. . We first describe experiments on 5 on bilayer NaCl/Au(111), where 5 exhibits a geometry corresponding to the calculated 5OS geometry, and an open-shell electronic configuration.\nWe compare the experimental data on this species to calculations on 5OS with a triplet configuration, as theory predicts a triplet ground state for 5OS. For 5OS, the calculated frontier orbitals correspond to the SOMOs ψ1 and ψ2 (Fig. ), whose spin up levels are occupied and the spin down levels are empty.\nFigure shows the DFT-calculated bond lengths of 5OS, where the two salient features, namely, the small difference in the bond lengths within each ring and the notably longer bond lengths in the pentagonal rings, agree with the open-shell resonance structure of 5 (Fig. ). Figure shows an AFM image of 5 adsorbed on bilayer NaCl/Au(111) that we assign as 5OS, where the bond-order differences qualitatively correspond to the calculated 5OS geometry (discussed and compared to the closed-shell state below).\nDifferential conductance spectra (dI/dV(V), where I and V denote the tunneling current and bias voltage, respectively) acquired on assigned 5OS exhibit two peaks centered at -1.5 V and 1.6 V (Fig. ), which we assign to the positive and negative ion resonances (PIR and NIR), respectively. Figure shows the corresponding STM images acquired at the onset (V = -1.2\nV/1.3 V) and the peak (V = -1.5 V/1.6 V) of the ionic resonances. To draw a correspondence between the STM images and the molecular orbital densities, we consider tunneling events as many-body electronic transitions between different charge states of 5OS (Fig. ). Within this framework, the PIR corresponds to transitions between 5 0 and the cationic state 5 .\nAt the onset of the PIR at -1.2 V, an electron can only be detached from the SOMO ψ1 and the corresponding STM image at -1.2 V shows the orbital density of ψ1. Increasing the bias to the peak of the PIR at -1.5 V, it becomes possible to also empty the SOMO ψ2, such that the corresponding STM image shows the superposition of ψ1 and ψ2, that is, |ψ1| 2 + |ψ2| 2 (ref.\n). Similarly, the NIR corresponds to transitions between 5 0 and 5 -1 . At the NIR onset of 1.3 V, only electron attachment to ψ2 is energetically possible. At 1.6 V, electron attachment to ψ1 also becomes possible, and the corresponding STM image shows the superposition of ψ1 and ψ2. The observation of the orbital densities of SOMOs, and not the hybridized HOMO and LUMO, proves the open-shell ground state of assigned 5OS.\nMeasurements of the monoradical species with a doublet ground state are shown in Supplementary Fig. . Unexpectedly, another species of 5 was also experimentally observed that exhibited a closedshell ground state. In contrast to 5OS, where the frontier orbitals correspond to the SOMOs ψ1 and ψ2, DFT calculations predict orbitals of different shapes and symmetries for 5para and 5ortho, denoted as α and β and shown in Fig. .\nFor 5ortho, α and β correspond to HOMO and LUMO, respectively. The orbitals are inverted in energy and occupation for 5para, where β is the HOMO and α is the LUMO. Fig. shows an AFM image of 5 that we assign as 5para. We experimentally infer its closed-shell state first by using qualitative bond order discrimination by AFM.\nIn high-resolution AFM imaging, chemical bonds with higher bond order are imaged brighter (that is, with higher frequency shift Δf) due to stronger repulsive forces, and they appear shorter . In Fig. , we label seven bonds whose bond orders show significant qualitative differences in the calculated 5ortho, 5para (Fig. ) and 5OS (Fig. ) geometries.\nIn 5para, the bonds b and d exhibit a higher bond order than a and c, respectively. This pattern is reversed for 5ortho, while the bond orders of the bonds a-d are all similar and small for 5OS. Furthermore, in 5para bond f exhibits a higher bond order than e, while in 5ortho and 5OS bonds e and f exhibit similar bond order (because they belong to Clar sextets).\nFinally, the bond labeled g shows a higher bond order in 5para than in 5ortho and 5OS. The AFM image of assigned 5para shown in Fig. indicates higher bond orders of the bonds b, d and f compared to a, c and e, respectively. In addition, the bond g appears almost point-like and with enhanced Δf contrast compared to its neighboring bonds, indicative of a high bond order (see Supplementary Fig. for height-dependent measurements).\nThese observations concur with the calculated 5para geometry (Fig. ). Importantly, all these distinguishing bond-order differences are distinctly different in the AFM image of 5OS shown in Fig. , which is consistent with the calculated 5OS geometry (Fig. ). In the AFM images of 5OS (Fig. and Supplementary Fig. ), the bonds a-d at the pentagon apices appear with similar contrast and apparent bond length.\nThe bonds e and f at one of the terminal benzenoid rings also exhibit similar contrast and apparent bond length, while the central bond g appears longer compared to assigned 5para. Further compelling evidence for the closed-shell state of assigned 5para is obtained by STM and STS. dI/dV(V) spectra acquired on an assigned 5para species exhibit two peaks centered at -1.4 V (PIR) and 1.6 V (NIR) (Fig. ).\nSTM images acquired at these biases (Fig. ) show the orbital densities of β (-1.4 V) and α (1.6 V). First, the observation of α and β as the frontier orbitals of this species, and not the SOMOs, strongly indicates its closed-shell state. Second, consistent with AFM measurements that indicate good correspondence to the calculated 5para geometry, we observe β as the HOMO and α as the LUMO.\nFor 5ortho, α should be observed as the HOMO and β as the LUMO. We did not observe molecules with the signatures of 5ortho in our experiments. We observed molecules in open-(5OS, Fig. ) and closed-shell (5para, Fig. ) states in similar occurrence after their generation from 6 on the surface. We could also switch individual molecules between open-and closed-shell states as shown in Fig. and Supplementary Fig. .\nTo this end, a change in the adsorption site of a molecule was induced by STM imaging at ionic resonances, which often resulted in movement of the molecule. The example presented in Fig. shows a molecule that was switched from 5para to 5OS and back to 5para. The switching is not directed, that is, we cannot choose which of the two species will be formed when changing the adsorption site, and we observed 5OS and 5para in approximately equal yields upon changing the adsorption site.\nThe molecule in Fig. is adsorbed on top of a defect that stabilizes its adsorption geometry on bilayer NaCl. At defect-free adsorption sites on bilayer NaCl, that is, without a third layer NaCl island or atomic defects in the vicinity of the molecule, 5 could be stably imaged neither by AFM nor by STM at ionic resonances (Supplementary Fig. ).\nWithout changing the adsorption site, the state of 5 (open-or closedshell) never changed, including the experiments on bilayer NaCl/Ag(111) and Cu(111), on which the charge state of 5 could be switched (Supplementary Figs. ). Also on these lower work function surfaces, both open-and closed-shell species were observed for 5 0 and both showed charge bistability between 5 0 (5OS or 5para) and 5 -1 (Supplementary Figs. ).\nThe geometrical structure of 5 -1 probed by AFM, and its electronic structure probed by STM imaging at the NIR (corresponding to transitions between 5 -1 and the dianionic state 5 -2 ), are identical within the measurement accuracy for the charged species of both 5OS and 5para. When cycling the charge state of 5 between 5 0 and 5 -1 several times, we always observed the same state (5OS or 5para) when returning to 5 0 , provided the molecule did not move during the charging/discharging process.\nBased on our experimental observations we conclude that indeno[1,2-a]fluorene (5), the last unknown indenofluorene isomer, can be stabilized in and switched between an open-shell (5OS) and a closed-shell (5para) state on NaCl. For the former, both DFT and QD-NEVPT2 calculations predict a triplet electronic configuration.\nTherefore, 5 can be considered to exhibit the spin-crossover effect, involving magnetic switching between high-spin (5OS) and low-spin (5para) states, coupled with a reversible structural transformation. So far, the spin-crossover effect has mainly only been observed in transition-metal-based coordination compounds with a near-octahedral geometry .\nThe observation that the switching between open-and closedshell states is related to changes in the adsorption site but is not achieved by charge-state cycling alone, indicates that the NaCl surface and local defects facilitate different electronic configurations of 5 depending on the adsorption site.\nGas-phase QD-NEVPT2 calculations predict that 5OS is the ground state, and the closed-shell 5para and 5ortho states are 0.11 and 0.21 eV higher in energy. The experiments, showing bidirectional switching between 5OS and 5para, indicate that a change in the adsorption site can induce sufficient change in the geometry of 5 (leading to a corresponding change in the ground state electronic configuration) and thus induce switching.\nSwitching between open-and closed-shell states in 5 does not require the breaking or formation of covalent bonds , but a change of adsorption site on NaCl where the molecule is physisorbed. Our results should have implications for single-molecule devices, capitalizing on the altered electronic and chemical properties of a system in π-diradical open-shell and closed-shell states such as frontier orbital and singlet-triplet gaps, and chemical reactivity.\nFor possible future applications as a single-molecule switch, it might be possible to also switch between open-and closed-shell states by changing the local electric field, such as by using chargeable adsorbates . Scanning probe microscopy measurements and sample preparation. STM and AFM measurements were performed in a home-built system operating at base pressures below 1×10 -10 mbar and a base temperature of 5 K. Bias voltages are provided with respect to the sample.\nAll STM, AFM and spectroscopy measurements were performed with carbon monoxide (CO) functionalized tips. AFM measurements were performed in non-contact mode with a qPlus sensor . The sensor was operated in frequency modulation mode with a constant oscillation amplitude of 0.5 Å. STM measurements were performed in constantcurrent mode, AFM measurements were performed in constant-height mode with V = 0 V, and I(V) and Δf(V) spectra were acquired in constant-height mode.\nPositive (negative) values of the tip-height offset Δz represent tip approach (retraction) from the STM setpoint. All dI/dV(V) spectra are obtained by numerical differentiation of the corresponding I(V) spectra. STM and AFM images, and spectroscopy curves, were post-processed using Gaussian low-pass filters.\nAu(111), Ag(111) and Cu(111) surfaces were cleaned by iterative cycles of sputtering with Ne + ions and annealing up to 800 K. NaCl was thermally evaporated on Au(111), Ag(111) and Cu(111) surfaces held at 323 K, 303 K and 283 K, respectively. This protocol results in the growth of predominantly bilayer (100)-terminated islands, with a minority of trilayer islands.\nSub-monolayer coverage of 6 on surfaces was obtained by flashing an oxidized silicon wafer containing the precursor molecules in front of the cold sample in the microscope. CO molecules for tip functionalization were dosed from the gas phase on the cold sample. Density functional theory calculations. DFT was employed using the PSI4 program package .\nAll molecules with different charge (neutral and anionic) and electronic (open-and closed-shell) states were independently investigated in the gas phase. The B3LYP exchangecorrelation functional with 6-31G basis set was employed for structural relaxation and singlepoint energy calculations. The convergence criteria were set to 10 −4 eV Å −1 for the total forces and 10 −6 eV for the total energies.\nMultireference calculations. Multireference calculations were performed on the DFToptimized geometries using the QD-NEVPT2 level of theory , with three singlet roots and one triplet root included in the state-averaged calculation. A (10,10) active space (that is, 10 electrons in 10 orbitals) was used along with the def2-TZVP basis set .\nIncreasing either the active space size or expanding the basis set resulted in changes of about 50 meV for relative energies of the singlet and triplet states. These calculations were performed using the ORCA program package . Nucleus-independent chemical shift (NICS) calculations. Isotropic nucleus-independent chemical shift values were evaluated at the centre of each ring using the B3LYP exchangecorrelation functional with def2-TZVP basis set using the Gaussian 16 software package .\nStarting materials (reagent grade) were purchased from TCI and Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. Reactions were carried out in flame-dried glassware and under an inert atmosphere of purified Ar using Schlenk techniques. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on Silica Gel 60 F-254 plates (Merck).\nColumn chromatography was performed on silica gel (40-60 µm). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Varian Mercury 300 or Bruker Varian Inova 500 spectrometers. Mass spectrometry (MS) data were recorded in a Bruker Micro-TOF spectrometer. The synthesis of compound 6 was developed following the two-step synthetic route shown in Supplementary Fig. , which is based on the preparation of methylene-bridge polyarenes by means of Pd-catalyzed activation of benzylic C-H bonds .\nSupplementary Figure | Synthetic route to obtain compound 6. The complex Pd2(dba)3 (20 mg, 0.02 mmol) was added over a deoxygenated mixture of 1,3-dibromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene (9, 100 mg, 0.38 mmol), boronic acid 10 (178 mg, 1.14 mmol), K2CO3 (314 mg, 2.28 mmol) and XPhos (35 mg, 0.08 mmol) in toluene (1:1, 10 mL), and the resulting mixture was heated at 90 °C for 2 h.\nAfter cooling to room temperature, the solvents were evaporated under reduced pressure. The reaction crude was purified by column chromatography (SiO2; hexane:CH2Cl2 9:1) affording 11 (94 mg, 76%) as a colorless oil.

After cooling to room temperature, H2O (30 mL) was added, and the mixture was extracted with EtOAc (3x15 mL). The combined organic extracts were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered, and evaporated under reduced pressure. The reaction crude was purified by column chromatography (SiO2; hexane:CH2Cl2 9:1) affording compound 6 (8 mg, 11%) as a white solid. in AFM imaging due to their reduced adsorption height compared to the rest of the carbon atoms.\nWe attribute this observation to the significantly different lattice parameter of Cu(111) (2.57 Å) compared to Au(111) and Ag(111) (2.95 Å and 2.94 Å, respectively) , such that the apical carbon atoms of the pentagonal rings of 5 adsorb on the on-top atomic sites on Au(111) and Ag(111), but not on Cu(111).\nOur speculation is based on a previous study of polymers of 1 on Au(111) by Di Giovannantonio et al. , where both tilted and planar individual units of 1 were observed depending on whether the apical carbon atoms of the pentagonal rings in 1 adsorbed on the on-top or hollow sites of the surface, respectively.\nGiven the strong molecule-metal interaction, we found no electronic state signatures of 5 on all three metal surfaces.
